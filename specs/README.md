# Specs

Ground-truth industry specifications this repo carries as reference
material, kept as plain files (not git submodules — `.gitmodules` at the
repo root is empty) parallel to `smo/`, the Phase 1 reference
implementation these specs describe. Moved here from the repo root so the
top level reads as `specs/` (what the industry defines) + `smo/` (what
this build implements), instead of seven unrelated top-level folders.

None of `smo/`'s code generates from these files or references their
paths — they are read-only reference material for grounding design and
implementation decisions, and for auditing `smo/`'s completeness against
the real, formal contracts (as opposed to `smo/`'s own audits so far in
`smo/OPEN_ITEMS.md` section 5, which compare against the O-RAN-SC
*source code* repos under the Repo Blueprint's ADOPT/REFERENCE list, a
different and complementary ground truth).

## What's here

- **`5G_APIs/`** — the full 3GPP 5G Core OpenAPI spec set (Release 20,
  ~540 files, most SBI-facing NFs like AMF/SMF/PCF/UDM that are out of
  SMO's scope entirely). The subset actually relevant to `smo/`'s
  modules is the ~95 `TS28xxx` management-plane specs — notably
  `TS28319_MsacNrm.yaml` (RAN NF OAM's `msacRole` gate),
  `TS28312_IntentNrm.yaml` (Policy Mgmt's Intent-driven flow),
  `TS28532_ProvMnS.yaml`/`PerfMnS.yaml`/`FileDataReportingMnS.yaml`/
  `HeartbeatNtf.yaml`/`StreamingDataMnS.yaml` (RAN NF OAM's CM write and
  PM subscription surface), `TS28111_FaultNrm.yaml`/`FaultNotifications.yaml`
  (RAN NF OAM's alarm handling), `TS28105_AiMlNrm.yaml` (AI/ML
  Workflow's own NRM — a full containment-tree model, audited in
  `smo/SPEC_AUDIT.md` and confirmed structurally different from this
  build's `aiml-fw`-shaped implementation), `TS28104_MdaNrm.yaml`/
  `TS28104_MdaReport.yaml` (RAN Analytics's own Management Data
  Analytics NRM, same audited-and-confirmed-different relationship to
  `aiml-fw-apm`'s shape), `TS29482_MLR_MLModelManagement.yaml`/
  `TS29482_MLR_ModelInformationDiscovery.yaml` (3GPP TS 29.482 AIMLE —
  a genuine Stage-3 ML-repository/model-discovery API, Release 19/20,
  much more directly applicable to MLMR's actual concept than
  TS28.105's abstract NRM containment tree; audited in
  `smo/SPEC_AUDIT.md`'s own MLMR section), and `TS28541_NrNrm.yaml`/
  `5GcNrm.yaml` (network resource modeling generally).
- **`MnS/`** — the 3GPP SA5 MnS repository content (YANG modules under `MnS/yang-models/`, OpenAPI under
  `MnS/OpenAPI/`, `measData.xsd`; each folder's README is 3GPP's own). Of it, `smo/` uses the YANG as a
  definitions library: `scripts/ingest_yang_schema.py --library MnS/yang-models` resolves the `_3gpp-common-*`
  groupings the O-RAN modules import (`PR-SB-3`).
- **`O-RAN-WG10-O1NRM-YANGs/`**, **`O-RAN-WG10-IMDM-YANGs/`** — O-RAN's
  own O1 Network Resource Model and Information/Data Model YANG modules.
  Relevant to RAN NF OAM's `ManagedEntity`/CM write shape and
  `mock-o1-adaptor`'s NETCONF surface.
- **`O-RAN-WG4-MP-YANGs/`** — O-RU management-plane YANGs.
  **Confirmed out of scope**, per explicit direction: this build's
  degenerate single-node Phase 1 topology doesn't model
  radio-unit-specific attribute/config detail at that granularity, and
  won't. The one already-relevant WG4 piece, Software Management's base
  RPC set (`o-ran-software-management.yang`), is separately already
  implemented (`smo/SPEC_AUDIT.md`'s DME/O1 Adaptor section item 3); any
  further WG4 "logic" beyond that base RPC engine is confirmed not
  needed either.
- **`O-RAN-WG5-O-CU-MP-YANGs/`**, **`O-RAN-WG5-O-DU-MP-YANGs/`** —
  O-DU/O-CU/O-RU-Aggregator management-plane YANGs. Not a flat gap:
  per confirmed architecture direction, DME/RAN NF OAM's MnS services
  and O1 IOC data model conformance for these NF types follow a
  per-vendor own/spec/combined approach (a vendor's own model, the
  formal spec's model, or a hybrid) rather than one hard-coded shape —
  the same per-vendor capability-registry principle
  `smo/docs/ownership/DME_OWNERSHIP.md` already names as this build's
  next natural step once a second RAN vendor exists to make it real.
- **`O1_Adaptor/O1_Adaptor_MnS_Hierarchy_Mapping_v4.xlsx`** — a curated
  index across the above 3GPP/O-RAN files: every IOC reachable through
  ProvMnS's single generic `/{className}={id}` endpoint (3GPP NRM IOCs
  plus O-RAN WG10-O1NRM/WG5-O-DU/WG5-O-CU augments), the 3 genuinely
  dedicated 3GPP APIs (PM Job Control, File Data Reporting, Streaming
  Data Reporting), O-RAN WG4 Software Management's RPC/notification set,
  and (informational only) WG5's O-RU schema-mount points. User-supplied
  and hand-curated, not machine-generated — the ground truth for DME/RAN
  NF OAM's O1 Adaptor surface; see `smo/SPEC_AUDIT.md`'s new DME/O1
  Adaptor section for the line-by-line comparison against this build.
- **`o-cloud-im/`** — O-RAN WG6's real O2IMS information model
  (`resources/ORAN.O2ims.*.yaml`: Inventory, Common, Artifacts, Cluster,
  Infrastructure, Provisioning). Directly relevant to FOCOM's
  `/inventory`, `/resource-types`, `/resource-pools`,
  `/deployment-managers` routes — audited so far only against `pti-o2`'s
  Python implementation of this same interface, not this formal spec
  itself.

A line-by-line comparison against seven modules' most directly relevant
files has been done — RAN NF OAM, FOCOM, Policy Mgmt, SME, AI/ML
Workflow, RAN Analytics, and DME/O1 Adaptor (via the curated mapping
workbook above); see `smo/SPEC_AUDIT.md` for the findings. Not yet
compared against: A1 Related/Onboarding+rApp Mgmt (no relevant spec file
exists here for either). The O-RAN WG4 O-RU management-plane YANGs'
attribute-level detail is confirmed out of scope, not merely unaudited
(see above); WG5's O-DU/O-CU/O-RU-Aggregator YANGs are partially indexed
by the O1 Adaptor mapping workbook but deliberately not compared
attribute-by-attribute against one fixed shape — per-vendor own/spec/
combined conformance is the confirmed design, not a gap to close by
picking one model.

## Specification release table (`STD-2.1`)

What release or version of each specification this build is checked against, as the files themselves state it, and which module realises it. Written
from the files in this directory and from what `smo/` cites (October 2026). Where a file gives no release, the cell says so: no release is inferred from
anywhere but the file.

How to read the "Release / version" column:

- **3GPP OpenAPI files** (`5G_APIs/`, `MnS/OpenAPI/`) carry the version of the OpenAPI document in `info.version`. For the 28-series that number is the TS version
  the document was generated from (3GPP numbers a Release 19 document `19.x.y` and a Release 20 one `20.x.y`); the file does not say "Release" in words, so "Rel-19" below is
  read from the number. Files for TS 29.222 and TS 29.482 name their TS version in `externalDocs`; that is quoted. `©` is the copyright year in the file header.
- **O-RAN YANG** files carry a `revision` date per module; the range of the folder is given.
- **O-RAN specifications that are not in `specs/`** (R1AP, the SMO architecture, the O2 and O1 specifications as documents): the repository records no version for them. They are listed
  because the code cites them; the version is **not recorded** and is not assessed here.
- **RFCs** are identified by number and have no release.

"Where" is a section of [`smo/docs/STANDARDS.md`](../smo/docs/STANDARDS.md) where one exists, otherwise the module README that holds the mapping.

cite them, so they are not listed one by one.

### 3GPP SA5 repository content (`MnS/`)

| Content | Release / version | Realised by | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MnS/yang-models/` (133 YANG modules, `_3gpp-*`) | module `revision` 2019-01-14 (an imported IETF module) to 2026-08-01. The folder's own `README.md` (3GPP's, © 2024) names Rel-19 as the "current working in progress" release; the files do not say which release the newest modules belong to: **not assessed** | RAN NF OAM, as a definitions library for the `_3gpp-common-*` groupings the O-RAN modules import (`scripts/ingest_yang_schema.py --library MnS/yang-models`, `PR-SB-3`) | `ran-nf-oam/README.md` |

## Newer releases (`STD-2.2`, minimal)

This list holds only what can be stated from the files and from RFC numbering. It is **not** a currency assessment.

- **Inside the directory the releases are mixed**, which matters when a clause is cited: TS 28.104 and TS 28.312 are at 20.0.0, TS 28.105 at 19.5.0, the TS 28.541 NR NRM at 19.6.0 (the 5GC NRM at 20.3.0),
  TS 28.532 ProvMnS at 19.2.0, TS 28.111 and TS 28.319 at Rel-19, the Heartbeat file at 18.1.0, TS 29.482 at V19.1.0, TS 29.222 at V20.0.0 for five files and V19.5.0 for one. Whether a
  newer version of TS 28.105 or of the TS 28.541 NR NRM exists, and what it would change, is **not assessed**.
- **RFC 7807 is obsoleted by RFC 9457** (Problem Details for HTTP APIs, 2023). The error body this build uses has the same shape; moving the citation changes no field. Not scheduled.
- **RFC 7230 is obsoleted by RFCs 9110 and 9112** (2022). The citation concerns hop-by-hop header names only. Not scheduled.
- Everything else in the tables (the O-RAN specification versions, the O2 and R1AP documents, TS 28.552 / 28.554, the YANG releases) is **not assessed**. An assessment is `STD-2.2` proper and stays open in
  `smo/OPEN_ITEMS.md`; the inventory above is its starting point.
