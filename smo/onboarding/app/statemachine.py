"""The ApplicationPackage lifecycle: its states, its events, and the transition table `ONBOARDING_FSM`.

What it is: the table that decides which package events are legal from which state, and the two guards behind the cascade-delete and deprime rules. It
implements SMO Design v1.3 section 3.4 (AVAILABLE <-> DEPRECATED -> deleted), extended by Onboarding/rApp Mgmt LLD section 3 (the FAILED terminal state) and
section 4 (the cascade-delete guard as an actual query), and by the package priming stage of HISTORY.md §5.

Where it sits: `app/main.py` fires events on this table (`ONBOARDING_FSM.fire`, `_fire`) and stores the returned state; the generic engine is
`smo_shared/statemachine.py`. The table holds no per-package state.

What it owns: the allowed transitions and the guards. It does not write the package row, commit, or map a refusal to HTTP (`main._fire` does). A direct delete
of a FAILED package is not an edge here: the route handles it without the FSM.

Before editing: README section 2.3 lists the same table; change both together. A guard receives the keyword arguments `db` and `package` that `fire` is called with.
