"""Package validation, the part of Onboarding that needs neither the database nor the web framework.

`validate_package_bytes` is what `POST /packages` runs on a fetched CSAR (`app/main.py` fetches it, then calls this) and what the offline validator of
the rApp conformance pack runs on a file (`conformance/rapp`, PR-RAPP-3.1), so a developer sees the verdict Onboarding will give. It raises
`PackageValidationFailed` (with the reason) or one of the parse errors in `PARSE_FAILURES`; the caller treats all of them as "this package fails".

PR-RAPP-1: when a trust store is given the package signature is checked (smo_shared/csar_signing.py), and `require_signed` refuses a package that has none.
