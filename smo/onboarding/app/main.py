"""Software Package Onboarding SMOS: the HTTP routes that onboard an rApp package (a TOSCA CSAR) and govern its lifecycle.

What it is: the FastAPI app of the `onboarding` module (R1 route `/onboarding` via R1 Termination). `POST /packages` fetches a CSAR from a caller-given
location, validates it (`package_validation.py`), registers its artifacts, asks NFO to create the NF deployment descriptor, and leaves the package
AVAILABLE or FAILED. The other routes move the package through its lifecycle (`statemachine.py`), register usage by rApp instances, and list packages,
artifacts and usages.

Where it sits: rApp Management, AIMgF and the GUI BFF call it over R1; it calls NFO (`POST /nfo/descriptors`) through `R1Client`, and fetches the package
itself with a plain HTTP GET (not over R1). Design: SMO Design v1.3 section 3.4 and Onboarding/rApp Mgmt LLD sections 1-4; module README sections 1.5 and 2.

What it owns: the `application_package`, `artifact` and `package_usage_registration` tables (`models.py`). It does not store the package bytes, deploy
anything or register SME declarations (rApp Management does that per instance).

Before editing: the names re-exported from `package_validation` below (marked noqa F401) are imported from here by the tests and by
`fuzz/fuzz_csar_parsers.py`; keep them importable. `POST /packages` commits twice on purpose (see `onboard_package`).
