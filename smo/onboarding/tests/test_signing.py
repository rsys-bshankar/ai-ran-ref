"""Package signatures at onboarding (PR-RAPP-1.3 to 1.5): a signed package is verified against the trust store, and a signed package can be required.

Only the network fetch and the NFO call are faked; the CSAR bytes, the signature and the trust-store directory named by the environment are real. Fixtures: `client` (the app
over an in-memory SQLite), `publisher` (a trust store with one publisher, `acme`, and its private key, set through ONBOARDING_TRUST_STORE) and the autouse `nfo` (fakes NFO and
clears the two policy variables). Run: `cd smo/onboarding && PYTHONPATH=.:../shared python -m pytest tests/test_signing.py -q`.
