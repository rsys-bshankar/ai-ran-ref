# SMO Standards, Decisions and Runtime Realization

What the platform implements and how it maps to the standards: the frozen
design decisions, the TS 28.105 / 28.104 / 28.312 compliance matrices and the
runtime realization of the AI/ML execution roles. It describes the current
state. How and when it was built is in [HISTORY.md](../HISTORY.md); what is
still open is in [OPEN_ITEMS.md](../OPEN_ITEMS.md); the architecture itself is in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Source tags: `[W49]` = SMO_Waves_4to9.docx (pre-roadmap artifact checklist);
`[W10]` = SMO_Wave_10.docx (raw Wave 10 proposal); `[W10C]` =
SMO_Wave_10_Consolidated.docx (Wave 10 v1.0, canonical over `[W10]`).

## Frozen decisions

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|-------|----------|
| D-1 | Intent → O1 enactment | **Generic platform O1-CM Intent handler (RMIH)** in SA SMOS. It translates CM-shaped intent expectations into DME `/actions` → RAN NF OAM for *any* rApp, and posts IntentReports (W8-07). |
| D-1b | ASSIST semantics | The operator can **approve** (resolve, with scope) **or reject**. The dispatch stays `AWAITING_SCOPE` until one of the two; `/reject` → `REJECTED` (W8-08). |
| D-2 | O1 actuator | **Both, configurable per rApp instance**: `NRCellDU.administrativeState` (LOCKED/UNLOCKED) **or** `CESManagementFunction.energySavingControl` (TO_BE_ENERGY_SAVING/TO_BE_NOT_ENERGY_SAVING). `administrativeState` is on NRCellDU, where TS 28.541 places it. |
| D-3 | 3-state model | **rApp-internal** `SERVING / PRE_SLEEP / SLEEP`. PRE_SLEEP is the 60-min sustained-low-PRB window. Only PRE_SLEEP→SLEEP produces an O1 write. |
| D-4 | APIs | **Existing DME types/DataJobs + `/actions`**, plus thin SDK wrappers named as in the docs (`get_dataset`, `start_training`, `store_model`, `get_prediction`, `execute_action`). |
| D-5 | Guard data | **RAN NF OAM ManagedEntity attributes**: cell classification (emergency, coverage-critical, sector group / last sector, incident zone) and neighbour list, readable by any rApp (W9-06). |
| D-6 | Model | **Threshold + linear regression** (next-hour PRB), stored as a plain serialized artifact. LSTM is backlog. |
| D-7 | Emulation input | Synthetic `PRB_UTILIZATION_SIM` DME type fed by a sample producer. |
| D-9 | Waves 4–6 depth | **Full spec compliance at REST level.** Every IOC, attribute, enum, operation and notification of TS 28.105 / 28.104 / 28.312 as REST resources/fields in the existing services, with spec names. The one recorded deviation is **addressing**: flat REST, no DN containment tree. FL/RL and MLUpdateFunction included. |

Resolved without a decision:
- **Test-case IDs.** `[W10C]` TC01–TC33 is canonical. The extra `[W10]` assertions (NETCONF timeout ⇒ alarm + no lifecycle corruption; PRB=3% sleep trigger) are folded into TC16/TC17/TC08.
- **Retry.** "Max 3 retries" = immediate, then +5/+10/+20 s (4 attempts). Notifications are retried 0 times, best-effort.
- **Lifecycle states** in `[W49]`/`[W10]` are subsets of the real FSM, not a gap.

## Standards compliance

Which release of each spec the matrices refer to (the version in the spec file, and every other spec the code cites) is recorded in [`../../specs/README.md`](../../specs/README.md#specification-release-table-std-21); the releases are mixed (TS 28.105 at 19.5.0, TS 28.104 and TS 28.312 at 20.0.0).

All three matrices are generated from the spec YAML in `specs/5G_APIs/`, and
the generator checks that every attribute marked Compliant appears by name in
the implementing code. Attributes of one IOC that share a status and need no
note are listed together in one table row.

**Addressing is the one deviation that applies to every row.** DN-typed
attributes (`Dn`, `DnRo`, `DnListRo`) carry resource ids (UUIDs); resources
are flat REST collections, not a DN containment tree. Each resource is
returned as `{"id", "attributes"}`, mirroring the spec's `-Single` shape.
Containment is a `…Ref` attribute on the child ("containment as reference").

### Compliance limits (what stops "100%")

"Compliant" above means the spec YAML is realised as REST resources with spec
names and enums. It does not mean full conformance to the whole TS. Each
limit below is tracked in [`../OPEN_ITEMS.md`](../OPEN_ITEMS.md) §3.

| Standard | Module(s) | REST-level status | Limits to 100% |
|---|---|---|---|
| TS 28.104 | MDAF | 48/48 rows | `STREAMING` is recorded, not streamed (SA-MDA-5, no TS 28.532 streaming transport); `recommendationFilter`, `performanceThresholdInfo`, `analysisRequirements`, `thresholdMonitorRefList` stored not enforced; `areaScope` stored not matched; backing-model refs set by the caller; flat addressing |
| TS 28.312 | Intent Service | 91/91 rows | Flat addressing; `DateTime` / `FullTime` checked by shape; the Intent Service validates and routes, the RMIHs realise the expectations (SA SMOS: `IS_EQUAL_TO` target setting only) |
| TS 28.105 | AIMgF, MLMR, MLLF, runtime | 125/126 attributes | `ThresholdMonitors` (TS 28.623 containment, MLMF equivalent); FL/RL stored, no training engine; runtime scale has no target size; flat addressing |
| TS 29.482 | MLMR | `MLModel`, storages / profiles, `storeDiscReqs`, discovery at REST level | `accessReqs.location` not enforced; phase written at training start / success only; the `MLModel` `anyOf` and forward-compatible enums not honoured |
| TS 28.532 / 28.111 / 28.319 | RAN NF OAM | MSAC, `accessScope`, `PerceivedSeverity`, DN refs and file reporting closed | Streaming reporting (SA-RANOAM-8); DN containment tree (SA-RANOAM-4); MSAC guards CM writes only; Jex subset for `dataNodeSelector` |
| O2IMS | FOCOM | Inventory sites, fault, performance, artifacts / cluster / infrastructure / provisioning at REST level | `FILE` / `STREAM` performance reporting; no real cluster behind a ProvisioningRequest; flat addressing |
| TS 28.541 + WG10/WG5 | RAN NF OAM | 3GPP descriptor plus WG10 O1 NRM and WG5 O-DU / O-CU descriptors bundled | The 3GPP common YANG modules are not in `specs/`, so the attributes they contribute are missing from the YANG descriptors; WG4 M-plane not ingested |

RAN Analytics is not in this table: it realises no standard (it is a producer
registry, separate from MDAF).

The 16 spec-conformance items were closed module by module, each in its own PR with
the matching `OPEN_ITEMS.md` and matrix rows updated: RAN NF OAM (5), FOCOM (4), MLMR (5),
Intent Service (1), O1 vendor models (1). What each left open is in the table above and in
[`../OPEN_ITEMS.md`](../OPEN_ITEMS.md) §3.

### TS 28.105

AI/ML NRM, AIMgF and MLMR (`specs/5G_APIs/TS28105_AiMlNrm.yaml`).

| | Count |
|---|---|
| IOCs | 20, all REST resources |
| Attributes / children | 126 |
| Compliant | 125 |
| Deviation | 1: `MLTrainingFunction.ThresholdMonitors` |

- **Not a parallel model.** An MLTrainingRequest *is* a `TrainingJob`, an
  MLTestingRequest *is* a `ValidationJob`; both start through the same core
  (`_start_training` / `_start_validation` in `aimgf/app/main.py`), so the
  lifecycle gate, the operator approvals and the NFO execution runtimes
  apply to NRM-created runs. Every training run gets an MLTrainingProcess;
  every completion writes MLTrainingReport, MLTestingReport or
  AIMLInferenceReport (emulation and inference).
- **Behaviour.** `cancelRequest` / `suspendRequest` / `cancelProcess` /
  `suspendProcess` act on the run; `activationStatus` gates inference; an
  MLModelLoadingRequest brings the serving runtime up through
  RuntimeLifecycle (NFO); an MLUpdateRequest runs FINE_TUNING training per
  model and writes the MLUpdateReport once every run is terminal.
- **FL/RL.** `FLRequirement`, `RLRequirement`, `FLParticipationInfo`,
  `SupportedLearningTechnology`, `FLReportPerClient` are validated against
  the spec enums and stored; there is no distributed-training engine to
  consume them.
- **The deviation.** `ThresholdMonitors` is a containment of TS 28.623's
  `ThresholdMonitor`, not a TS 28.105 IOC. Model-performance threshold
  monitoring is AIMgF MLMF (`/aimgf/mlmf/subscriptions`, `guardKpiFloor`),
  recorded as the equivalent in HISTORY.md §7 (TS 28.105 item 7).

#### MLMR ownership review (W4-02)

| Concern | Owner | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Model identity, version, artifacts | MLMR | `MLModel` (`mLModelId` = `model_id`, `mLModelVersion` = `version`), `ModelArtifact` |
| TS 28.105 writable MLModel attributes | MLMR | Columns on `aiml_model`, accepted on register and update |
| `mLTrainingType`, `aIMLInferenceReportRefList`, `usedByFunctionRefList` (read-only) | AIMgF | Joined into `GET /mlmr/ml-models/{id}` from `GET /aimgf/ml-models/{id}/nrm-refs` over R1; empty if AIMgF is unreachable |
| Repository container | MLMR | `MLModelRepository`; deleting it un-contains its models and groups (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) |
| Coordination groups | MLMR | `memberMLModelRefList` = `member_model_ids` (minItems 2) |
| Lifecycle state | AIMgF | MLMR stores no lifecycle |

#### InferenceRuntime mapping (W4-03)

`[W49]`'s `InferenceRuntime` is realised by two existing pieces:
**AIMLInferenceFunction** (the logical inference host: `activationStatus`,
`managedActivationScope`, loaded models) and **RuntimeLifecycle** (AIMgF
`runtime_lifecycle_state` + `nf_deployment_id`, the NFO-backed MLIF serving
deployment that MLModelLoadingProcess drives NOT_DEPLOYED → DEPLOYED →
ACTIVE). An inference names the model (runtime must be ACTIVE) and
optionally the function (must be ACTIVATED with the model loaded).

### TS 28.104

MDA NRM, MDAF (`specs/5G_APIs/TS28104_MdaNrm.yaml`, `TS28104_MdaReport.yaml`;
`mdaf/app/mda.py`). 48 rows, 48 compliant. Recorded deviations: addressing,
and the `STREAMING` reporting method's transport.

- **Request-driven on top of producer-push.** The producer-push surface
  (`POST /reports`, `/subscriptions`, ThresholdInfo notification) is
  unchanged. An MDARequest declares the outputs it wants, with per-IE
  `filterValue`, edge-triggered `threshold` (hysteresis) and `timeOut`
  filters, for a scope and a `startTime`/`stopTime` window. Every report,
  spec-shaped (`POST /mda-reports`) or legacy (`POST /reports`), is matched
  against all open requests and delivered per `reportingMethod`:
  `NOTIFICATION` (best-effort POST to `reportingTarget`), `FILE`
  (`GET /mda-reports/{id}/file` + `notifyFileReady`), `STREAMING` (recorded
  and retrievable, not streamed: there is no TS 28.532 `StreamingDataMnS`
  transport).
- **Typed outputs.** `mDAOutputList` is validated against the output type its
  `mDAType` selects (9 MDATypes have typed outputs); other types use
  MDAOutputEntry pairs, which the spec allows for all types.
- **Report kinds (W5-02)** `ANALYTICS` / `PREDICTION` / `DRIFT`, inferred
  from the MDAType or set with `reportKind`.

### TS 28.312

Intent NRM, Intent Service (`specs/5G_APIs/TS28312_IntentNrm.yaml` and the
five `TS28312_*Expectation.yaml` family files). 91 rows, all compliant.
Recorded deviation: addressing.

- **Strict.** `POST /intents` and `POST /autonomy-dispatches` accept only
  spec-valid intents: required `userLabel`, `intentExpectations` (≥ 1) and
  `intentReportControl` (with `observationPeriod`); each expectation needs an
  `expectationId`, an `expectationObject` and ≥ 1 target; closed enums
  throughout.
- **Expectation families.** `scripts/generate_ts28312_families.py` generates
  `intent-service/app/ts28312_families.py`: 34 specialised targets and 41
  specialised contexts. A specialised name must use its own condition and
  value range (for example `AveDLPrbLoad` is `IS_LESS_THAN` with an integer
  0..100); any other name is the generic ExpectationTarget/Context.
- **At creation:** every expectation object type needs a capability on the
  addressed RMIH; a purpose needing negotiation (FEASIBILITY_CHECK /
  EXPLORATION / FULFILMENT_WITH_NEGOTIATION) must be in the RMIH's
  `supportedNegotiationFunctionalities` when it declares any; target
  feasibility is checked against `supportedExpectationTargetInfoList` (a
  FEASIBILITYCHECK* intent is accepted with an INFEASIBLE report, a
  fulfilment intent with an infeasible target is rejected); a TARGET_CONFLICT
  is reported against other ACTIVATED intents on the same object instance;
  the initial IntentReport (NOT_FULFILLED / RECEIVED) becomes
  `intentReportReference`.
- **Reports** go to each `intentReportControl.reportRecipientAddress` whose
  `expectedReportTypes` they match. Deactivation reports SUSPENDED. A
  consumer answers a negotiation report with
  `POST /intents/{id}/negotiation-feedback`.

## Runtime realization

The four AI/ML execution roles (MLTF / MLVF / MLEF / MLIF) are ordinary NFO
deployments driven by AIMgF.

### Deployment model per role (W7-02)

| Role | Spec realisation | Started by | NFO descriptor (`workloadTemplate`) | Lifetime | Ended by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MLTF** (training) | TrainingJob = MLTrainingRequest + MLTrainingProcess | `POST /training-jobs`, `POST /ml-training-requests`, group retrain, MLUpdateRequest | `{jobKind: TRAINING, jobId, resources}` | Transient: one descriptor + deployment per run | Completion, cancel, supersede, or timeout (`DELETE /nfo/deployments/{id}`) |
| **MLVF** (validation / testing) | ValidationJob = MLTestingRequest | `POST /validation-jobs`, `POST /ml-testing-requests` | `{jobKind: VALIDATION, jobId, resources}` | Transient | Completion, cancel, or timeout |
| **MLEF** (emulation) | EmulationJob on an AIMLInferenceEmulationFunction | `POST /emulation-jobs` | `{jobKind: EMULATION, jobId, resources}` | Transient | Completion or timeout |
| **MLIF** (inference) | RuntimeLifecycle + AIMLInferenceFunction | `POST /models/{id}/runtime/deploy`, or MLModelLoadingRequest / Policy | `{modelId, jobKind: INFERENCE, resources}` | Long-lived serving deployment | `POST /models/{id}/runtime/terminate` |

| MLIF RuntimeLifecycle step | NFO call |
|---|---|
| NOT_DEPLOYED → DEPLOYMENT_REQUESTED → DEPLOYED | CreateDescriptor + Instantiate |
| ACTIVATING → ACTIVE | none (AIMgF's own gate) |
| SCALING → ACTIVE | `POST /deployments/{id}/scale` |
| TERMINATING → TERMINATED | `DELETE /deployments/{id}` |

Each inference job references the serving deployment and never creates its
own. NFO `HEAL` (call flow 15) applies to all four roles.

### Runtime profiles and timeouts

**Profiles (W7-03).** A package's `manifest.yaml` declares `executionModes`
and `runtimeProfiles: {TRAINING|VALIDATION|EMULATION|INFERENCE: {cpu, memory,
gpu}}`, at the top level or under `rappManifest`. Onboarding accepts only
known modes listed in `executionModes` with non-negative cpu/gpu (else the
package goes to FAILED) and exposes the profiles on `onboarding-status`. An
AIMgF request may name `packageId` (that package's profile for the mode) or
give an explicit `runtimeProfile` (which wins); the chosen profile is stored
on the job or lifecycle row and sent to NFO as `workloadTemplate.resources`.

**Timeouts (W7-04).** Defaults (`[W10C]` §13):

| Stage | Default |
|---|---|
| Training | 30 min |
| Validation | 15 min |
| Emulation | 30 min |
| Inference | 5 s |

Override per deployment with `AIMGF_TIMEOUT_<KIND>_SECONDS` and per request
with `timeoutSeconds` (`timeout_seconds` on inference). A run past
`started_at + timeout_seconds` fails cleanly: status FAILED and its NFO
runtime torn down; the model's lifecycle stage fails only if still legal;
MLTrainingProcess gets `resultStateInfo=TIMEOUT`, validation writes a FAILED
MLTestingReport, an ML update is advanced; the requester is notified
(`failureReason: TIMEOUT`). A late completion or resolve gets 409. A
SUSPENDED training run is paused and its clock restarts on resume. Expiry is
enforced lazily on every job read and completion, and on demand via
`POST /aimgf/execution-timeouts/sweep`.
