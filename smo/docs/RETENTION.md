# Retention

How long each high-volume table keeps its rows, which variable changes it, and what removes the rows (`PR-DB-3`). **Nothing is deleted by default**: a retention of `0` keeps the rows for ever, so an upgrade deletes nothing until an operator sets a number. Decided October 2026: the code defaults stay at `0`, and the values in the "Proposed value" column ship in a production sample values file and in `.env.example` (`DB-3.10`, 0.6.0), not as defaults. They are proposals for an operator to confirm, not legal advice; the retention a law or a contract requires is the operator's to decide (`docs/PRIVACY.md`).

## The table (`DB-3.1`)

| Table | Module | What a row is | Grows with | Setting (days; `0` keeps) | Proposed value (production sample) | Removed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `alarm` | RAN NF OAM | An alarm | Every alarm ingested | `SMO_RETENTION_ALARMS_DAYS` | 90 | Worker task `purge-cleared-alarms` (hourly) | Only an alarm **cleared** more than N days ago. An alarm still raised is never removed, however old |
| `pm_file` | RAN NF OAM | A PM file: the measurements are the row's `content`, there is **no file on disk** | Every PM file reported | `SMO_RETENTION_PM_FILES_DAYS` | 14 | Worker task `purge-pm-files` (hourly) | By `file_ready_time`. KPIs (`/kpi-schedules`, `/kpis/...`) read these rows, so keep at least the longest KPI look-back |
| `safeguard_refusal` | RAN NF OAM | A recorded refusal by a safeguard | Every refusal | `SAFEGUARD_REFUSAL_RETENTION_DAYS` (older name, kept) | 90 | Worker task `purge-safeguard-refusals` (hourly), or `POST /safeguard-refusals/purge` | Subscriptions are not touched |
| `rapp_action_approval`, `rapp_decision_record` | RAN NF OAM | An rApp action that waited for a person; why an rApp acted | Every held request; every rApp config job | none | keep | Nothing | The decision record carries a hash that is also in the audit chain, so deleting rows would be a tamper signal (`GET /decision-records/{id}` says `MISMATCH` for a changed record, not for a removed one); archive by exporting, as for the chain. A purge task with a signed marker is open |
| `mdaf_report` | MDAF | A published analytics report | Every report | `SMO_RETENTION_MDAF_REPORTS_DAYS` | 30 | Worker task `purge-reports` (hourly), in the new `mdaf-worker` | By `generated_at` |
| `gui_audit_log` | GUI BFF | Who did what through the GUI | Every proxied call, login and denial | `GUI_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` | 365 | `python -m app.retention`, run by cron or `kubectl exec` (the BFF has no worker; the chart has no CronJob: its SQLite volume belongs to one pod) | With `GUI_AUDIT_EXPORT_DIR` set, the rows are written there as JSON lines first, and only the rows written are deleted |
| `notification_outbox` | shared | A queued notification | Every notification | `SMO_OUTBOX_SENT_RETENTION_SECONDS` (existing, 86400) | 1 day | Every drain, for `SENT` rows | `DEAD` rows are **not** removed: they are what an operator looks at. A purge of `DEAD` rows is open |
| `idempotency_key` | shared | A stored answer for an idempotency key | Every command with a key | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_TTL_SECONDS` (existing, 86400) | 1 day | Purged when a key is written | |
| `audit_log` (platform chain) | R1 Termination | A hash-chained audit row | Every change through the gateway | none | keep | Nothing | Rows are never purged: removing the oldest breaks `verify`. Retention is by exporting (`python -m smo_shared.audit export`) and archiving. Pruning behind a signed checkpoint is open |
| `gui_login_failure` | GUI BFF | A failed-login counter | Names typed | none | – | Cleared by the name's next successful sign-in | Rows for names that never sign in accumulate; open |
| `gui_rapp_pin` | GUI BFF | A rApp a user pinned to the sidebar | At most 5 per user | none | – | Removed when the user unpins it or is deleted | Bounded by the limit, no growth to watch |

## The production sample and `.env.example` (`DB-3.10`)

The "Proposed value" column is not left as prose. For **Kubernetes**, `deploy/helm/smo/values-production.yaml` sets exactly those periods (`modules.ran-nf-oam-worker.env`, `modules.ran-nf-oam.env`, `modules.mdaf-worker.env`, `gui.env`); layer it on your values with `helm upgrade --install smo deploy/helm/smo -f deploy/helm/smo/values-production.yaml -f my-values.yaml`, and the `prod` GitOps overlay (`deploy/gitops/overlays/prod/values.yaml`) carries the same numbers. For **compose**, `.env.example` lists the variables, commented out, with the same values: copy the file to `.env` and uncomment the ones you confirm (compose passes each through to the worker). The chart's own defaults and the code's defaults stay at `0`, so installing or upgrading without those files deletes nothing. `tests_integration/test_retention_samples.py` fails when this table, the Helm sample, the GitOps overlay and `.env.example` disagree.

The GUI audit log has no worker and the chart has **no CronJob** for it, on purpose: the BFF keeps its SQLite file on a ReadWriteOnce volume that one pod may hold (it rolls with `Recreate`), so a second pod started by a CronJob could not open the file safely, or at all on another node. `values-production.yaml` puts `GUI_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` and `GUI_AUDIT_EXPORT_DIR` (`/data/audit-export`, on that volume) into the gui-bff pod, and the command runs inside that pod from your scheduler: `kubectl -n smo exec deploy/gui-bff -- python -m app.retention`. Archive the export directory off the volume before it fills it. On compose: `docker compose exec gui-bff python -m app.retention`, from cron on the host.

## A table with retention off that has grown large (`DB-3.10`)

A setting of `0` is a decision to keep, but a table nobody is watching can grow until the disk fills. Each purge task therefore also looks at its table when the retention is `0`: the worker estimates the row count (Postgres: the planner's `pg_class.reltuples`, which costs no scan and is kept by autovacuum, `-1` for a never-analysed table is read as 0; SQLite: `count(*)`), sets the gauge `smo_retention_off_rows{table}` (tables `alarm`, `pm_file`, `safeguard_refusal`, `mdaf_report`; no series once retention is on), and logs **one WARNING per table per UTC day** when the estimate is above `SMO_RETENTION_WARN_ROWS` (default `1000000`; `0` never warns, the gauge stays). The gauge is served by the worker's metrics port (`SMO_WORKER_METRICS_PORT`), refreshed hourly with the task; aggregate replicas with `max`. `python -m app.retention` for the GUI audit log does the same count and warning when `GUI_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` is `0`, but has no gauge: it is a command that exits, and the BFF does not install `smo_shared`, so the check is written out there. There is no alert rule yet: a table you chose to keep is not a fault, so an alert would page for a decision; graph or threshold `smo_retention_off_rows` yourself. Tested: `shared/tests/test_retention.py` (estimate, threshold, once a day, `0` never, retention on drops the series, a failed estimate never raises), `ran-nf-oam/tests/test_tasks.py`, `mdaf/tests/test_tasks.py`, `gui-bff/tests/test_retention.py`. Not tested: the `reltuples` query on a real Postgres (the unit test checks the statement, not a database).

## How it runs (`DB-3.7`)

The purges are tasks of the module's own worker (`python -m smo_shared.worker`, the single-runner of `PR-MSG-4`), so any number of workers runs a task at most once an hour across all of them, and a worker that dies frees the task for another. Each module's worker connects as that module's database role, so the purge can only touch that module's schema (`PR-DB-2`). A task is idempotent: it finds what is due from the database, deletes in batches of 1000 with a commit per batch, and may run again after a crash. A setting of `0` makes the task do nothing. The GUI audit purge is a command because the BFF is not on `smo_shared`:

```bash
GUI_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365 GUI_AUDIT_EXPORT_DIR=/var/lib/gui-bff/audit-export python -m app.retention
```

Compose passes each variable through from the environment (`.env`) to the worker; the Helm chart sets them under `modules.<worker>.env` (`ran-nf-oam-worker`, `mdaf-worker`); both default to `0`. The proposed periods are in `values-production.yaml` and `.env.example` (below).

## What is tested

`shared/tests/test_retention.py` (the purge deletes only rows older than the cutoff, leaves a row with no date, applies extra conditions, goes through more than one batch, refuses no age), `ran-nf-oam/tests/test_tasks.py` (only cleared alarms older than N days, PM files older than N days, nothing without a setting), `mdaf/tests/test_tasks.py`, `gui-bff/tests/test_retention.py` (only the old rows, exported first, a failed export deletes nothing), `tests_integration/test_retention_samples.py` (the samples agree with this table and the defaults keep everything). Not tested: a purge against Postgres at volume (the unit tests run on SQLite), and the time a purge takes on a table of millions of rows.

## Not built

Time partitioning of the PM table, so an old partition drops in one statement (`DB-3.8`; it rewrites a table and is a schema step of its own), a purge of `DEAD` outbox rows, pruning the platform audit chain behind a checkpoint, and an expiry for `gui_login_failure`.
