# rApp packaging

How an rApp is packaged for this SMO, what Onboarding validates, and which
part of each package file the platform actually uses. The reference packages
are the four directories under [`../samples/`](../samples/):

| Short name | Directory | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| ES | [`samples/energy-saving-rapp/`](../samples/energy-saving-rapp/README.md) | Energy Saving: cell sleep/wake from PRB forecasts |
| MO | [`samples/mobility-optimization-rapp/`](../samples/mobility-optimization-rapp/README.md) | Mobility Robustness Optimization: per-relation CIO |
| CO | [`samples/coverage-optimization-rapp/`](../samples/coverage-optimization-rapp/README.md) | Coverage Optimization: joint tilt / power |
| TS | [`samples/traffic-steering-rapp/`](../samples/traffic-steering-rapp/README.md) | Traffic Steering: idle priority and connected CIO |

Onboarding is [`../onboarding/README.md`](../onboarding/README.md); the code is
`onboarding/app/main.py` (`_validate_package`, `_parse_ai_capabilities`,
`_validate_runtime_profiles`, `_parse_sme_declarations`; the `operatorUi` check is `shared/smo_shared/operator_ui.py`).

A rApp need not be Python. The Java SDK's example rApp ([`../sdk-java/examples/hello-rapp/`](../sdk-java/README.md)) has a package of the same layout (§1) and
runs as its own container; §5 says what a non-Python rApp needs.

## 1. Package layout

An rApp package is a CSAR (a zip). `python3 samples/build_csar.py <name>`
zips `samples/<name>/` into `samples/<name>.csar` with fixed timestamps, so an
unchanged source rebuilds byte-identically (the integration suite fails if a
committed `.csar` is stale). Tests, caches and `__pycache__` are left out.

```
<name>.csar
├── TOSCA-Metadata/TOSCA.meta        required   entry point: Entry-Definitions: Definitions/asd.yaml
├── Definitions/asd.yaml             required   the Application Service Descriptor (ASD)
├── manifest.yaml                    optional   AI platform manifest (this build's extension)
├── capabilities.yaml                optional   SDK namespaces consumed / provided (this build's extension)
├── Artifacts/…                      optional   deployment items, e.g. Artifacts/Deployment/HELM/*.tgz
├── Files/Sme/{providers,serviceapis,invokers}/*.json   optional   CAPIF registrations
├── Files/Dme/{infoproducers,infoconsumers}/*.json      optional   DME type / job declarations
├── Files/Acm/definition/compositions.json              optional   ONAP ACM composition (not used)
└── app/, demo.py, …                 free       the rApp's own source (the rApps ship it here)
```

| Part | Read by | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `TOSCA-Metadata/TOSCA.meta` | Onboarding | Missing file or no `Entry-Definitions:` line fails validation (`ONBOARDING` → `FAILED`). |
| `Definitions/asd.yaml` | Onboarding (line scan) | Must exist. Eight flat properties become the package identity (§2). Onboarding then creates an NFO `NFDeploymentDescriptor` that references it. |
| `manifest.yaml`, `capabilities.yaml` | Onboarding (YAML parse) | Stored as the package's `aiCapabilities` JSON (the manifest's `operatorUi` page declaration included, §3.1) and returned by `GET /onboarding/packages` and `…/onboarding-status` (§3, §4). |
| `Artifacts/…` | Onboarding | Every file under `Artifacts/` is recorded as a package artifact. |
| `Files/Sme/…` | Onboarding → rApp Management | Providers and service APIs are stored raw at onboarding and registered with SME per instance at `bootstrap-complete`. |
| `Files/Dme/…` | The rApp itself | Declarations the rApp may post to DME when it starts (no reference rApp ships any). Onboarding does not read them. |
| `Files/Acm/…` | Nothing | An ONAP ACM composition. A package without it onboards identically. |

Both extension files are **optional and additive**: a package with neither
onboards unchanged and its `aiCapabilities` is `null`.

## 2. `Definitions/asd.yaml`

Onboarding reads these `applicationServiceDescriptor` properties by scanning
for `key: value` lines, not by parsing the YAML. A missing property is simply
absent from the result; none is enforced as mandatory.

| Property | Description | Stored as | ES / MO / CO / TS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `application_name` | rApp name | package `name` | `EnergySaving_rApp`, `MobilityOptimization_rApp`, `CoverageOptimization_rApp`, `TrafficSteering_rApp` |
| `application_version` | rApp version | package `version` | `"1.0.0"` |
| `provider` | Vendor | package `vendor` | `Radisys` |
| `descriptor_id` | ASD identity (UUID) | `descriptor_id` | set (distinct UUID each) |
| `descriptor_invariant_id` | Identity across versions | `descriptor_invariant_id` | set |
| `descriptor_version` | ASD version | `descriptor_version` | `"1.0.0"` |
| `schema_version` | ASD schema version | `schema_version` | `"2.0"` |
| `function_description` | Free text | not read | set |
| `artifacts:` (deployment items) | What to deploy: `type: tosca.artifacts.asd.deploymentItem`, `file`, `artifact_type`, `target_server`, `item_id` | not read as such; files under `Artifacts/` are recorded | **none**; see the note below |

The AI rApps declare no deployment items because they are not deployed from a
Helm chart: their services run as `docker-compose.yml` services and are reached
through the instance's operator API base (`operatorApiBase`, registered at rApp Management and reached through R1 Termination's `/rapps/{instanceId}/operator/...`). The CSAR is what
Onboarding validates and what carries the manifest, not what starts the
process. Package uniqueness is the SHA-256 of the whole CSAR, not the ASD ids.

## 3. `manifest.yaml`

`rappManifest` is the root key. `executionModes`, `autonomyModes`,
`requiredServices` and `runtimeProfiles` are accepted either under
`rappManifest` or at the top level of the file (the layout the rApps use).

"Used by" says what the platform does with the value today. "Descriptive"
means Onboarding ignores it: it travels in the CSAR (and its hash) for people
and tools, and nothing branches on it.

| Parameter | Description | Used by | ES | MO | CO | TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `operatorUi` | The operator page the rApp declares (§3.1). Under `rappManifest` or at the top level | **Validated** by Onboarding and stored in `aiCapabilities.operatorUi`; drawn by the GUI's generic renderer; the GUI backend calls exactly the routes it lists on the instance's `operatorApiBase` | declared (the ADR's worked example, verbatim) | declared | declared | declared |
| `rappManifest.manifestVersion` | Version of the manifest format | Stored in `aiCapabilities.manifestVersion` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` |
| `rappManifest.aiRuntimeSdkVersion` | `sdk/` contract version the rApp was built against | Stored in `aiCapabilities.aiRuntimeSdkVersion` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` | `"1.0"` |
| `executionModes` | Which of `TRAINING`, `VALIDATION`, `EMULATION`, `INFERENCE` the package supports | Stored; every `runtimeProfiles` key must be one of them | all four | all four | all four | all four |
| `autonomyModes` | Which of `SHADOW`, `ASSIST`, `AUTONOMOUS` the rApp supports | Stored and exposed only. The mode in force is the rApp *instance's* `autonomyMode`; nothing checks it against this list. | all three | all three | all three | all three |
| `requiredServices` | Platform services the rApp needs | Stored and exposed only; no deploy-time check | DME, AIMgF, MLMR, MLLF, RAN-NF-OAM | same | same | same |
| `runtimeProfiles.<MODE>.cpu` | CPU cores for that execution runtime | **Consumed by AIMgF**: sizes the transient NFO runtime for a Training / Validation / Emulation request that names the package (`packageId`); an explicit `runtimeProfile` in the request wins | 8 / 4 / 4 / 2 | 4 / 2 / 2 / 1 | 4 / 2 / 2 / 1 | 4 / 2 / 2 / 1 |
| `runtimeProfiles.<MODE>.memory` | Memory (string, e.g. `16Gi`) | as `cpu` | 16Gi / 8Gi / 8Gi / 4Gi | 8Gi / 4Gi / 4Gi / 2Gi | same as MO | same as MO |
| `runtimeProfiles.<MODE>.gpu` | GPUs | as `cpu` | 0 in every mode | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `name`, `version`, `vendor`, `ownerTeam`, `description`, `useCase`, `domain`, `deploymentModel` | Package description from the Wave 10 package proposal | Descriptive. Identity is taken from the ASD (§2), not from here. | set; `useCase: Energy Saving`, `deploymentModel: NonRT-RIC` | set | set | set |

The profile values in the `runtimeProfiles` row are listed in the order
TRAINING / VALIDATION / EMULATION / INFERENCE.

Validation of `runtimeProfiles` (`_validate_runtime_profiles`), each a
package failure (`FAILED`):

- it must be a mapping of mode → profile, and each profile a mapping;
- a mode must be one of the four execution modes;
- when `executionModes` is declared, every profile mode must appear in it;
- `cpu` and `gpu` must be non-negative numbers (booleans are refused);
- `memory` is kept as a string, unchecked.

### 3.1 `operatorUi`: the page a rApp declares

Optional. A rApp that declares nothing still has the generic page (lifecycle, faults, history, KPIs). The decision record is
[`adr/0004-operator-ui-declaration.md`](adr/0004-operator-ui-declaration.md) (read it for the meaning of every field);
the JSON Schema is [`schemas/operator-ui-1.schema.json`](schemas/operator-ui-1.schema.json), and a complete page, the Energy Saving
one, is [`schemas/operator-ui.energy-saving.example.yaml`](schemas/operator-ui.energy-saving.example.yaml). The smallest example is
`sdk/examples/hello_operator_ui.py`, and `smo_sdk.operator_ui` writes and checks a declaration (`sdk/README.md`).

```yaml
operatorUi:
  version: 1
  panels:
    - id: cells
      title: Cells
      kind: table
      source:
        path: "/instances/{instanceId}/cells"     # quote a route that has {…}: a bare { starts a YAML mapping
        refreshSeconds: 15
      rows: items
      rowKey: cellId
      columns:
        - {path: cellId, label: Cell}
        - {path: state, label: State, format: badge}
      rowDetail:                       # the drawer a click on a row opens: up to 6 blocks
        title: "Cell {row.cellId}"
        blocks:
          - {kind: json, title: Latest execution, path: latestDecision, empty: No decision yet.}
      rowActions:
        - id: unlock
          label: Unlock
          method: POST
          path: "/instances/{instanceId}/cells/{row.cellId}/unlock"
          confirm: Unlock this cell?
          success: Cell unlocked
          body: {operator: "{user}"}
```

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Panel kinds | `table`, `keyValues`, `kpis`, `chart`, `actions`; anything else is refused |
| Source | a GET route relative to the rApp's operator API base; `{instanceId}` is the open instance; in a row action also `{row.<field>}` |
| Row drawer | `rowDetail` of a table: a `title` and 1 to 6 blocks of kind `json`, `keyValues`, `table` or `chart`; a `table` or `chart` block reads a list field of the row or a per-row GET `source` whose route and query may use `{row.<field>}` (the table's `rowKey` or a column); no nesting. The per-row sources are declared routes (reads) |
| Field paths | dotted names, at most one `[]`; no `..`, `$`, index, wildcard or filter |
| Permission | the routes the GUI backend may call for the rApp are exactly the panels' `source` routes, the `rowDetail` per-row sources and the action routes; reads need viewer, changes operator; `readOnly: true` allows no change |
| Text | always drawn as text, never HTML or markdown |
| Limits | 64 KiB as JSON, 4 000 values, 20 panels, 20 columns, 30 key-value items, 12 tiles, 5 row actions, 6 row-detail blocks, 10 actions per panel, 8 inputs per action, route 200 and field path 100 characters, `refreshSeconds` 5 to 3600 |
| Extensions | keys starting `x-` are ignored (and not stored); any other unknown key is refused |
| Version | `1`; another value is refused |

Onboarding refuses a bad declaration with the place and the rule (`operatorUi.panels[2].columns[1].path: must not contain '..'`);

**Where the page's routes are served.** The routes are relative to the rApp's *operator API base*, which the instance registers at rApp Management: `operatorApiBase` in `POST /rapp-mgmt/instances` (an operator's choice, also in the GUI's Deploy dialog) or `PUT /rapp-mgmt/instances/<id>/operator-api` from the instance itself (a workload running with the instance's own credentials) or an operator. It must be an `http` or `https` URL without credentials, query or fragment and not a loopback, link-local or metadata address (checked when stored and before every call). The package carries no address: where the rApp runs is a fact of the deployment. A rApp with no registered base still has its page's `kpi` tiles and the platform overview, and the page says its operator API is not registered. The four sample rApps run in compose as one container each, under their own identity, so the demo scripts pass `operatorApiBase` when they create the instance.

**The samples.** Each sample's `manifest.yaml` declares its page at the end (an instance block, the Evaluate and Reconcile buttons, and the cells or relations table with a drawer); Energy Saving's is the ADR's example verbatim, and `samples/<name>/tests/test_operator_page.py` checks that every declared route, query parameter and field exists in the rApp's own answers. What a declared page cannot show is at the end of the ADR.
see §6.

Why a package leaves a parameter out:

- The four AI rApps declare all four execution modes and all three autonomy
  modes: each runs its decisions through `AutonomyDispatch`, which implements
  SHADOW (record only), ASSIST (operator confirms) and AUTONOMOUS (applies at
  once).
- ES declares larger TRAINING and VALIDATION profiles than the other three.
  The manifests do not record why.
- `gpu: 0` everywhere: the reference models are small (threshold / regression),
  see each rApp's `app/model/`.

## 4. `capabilities.yaml`

`capabilities.consumes` and `capabilities.provides` are lists of
`{namespace, description}`, where `namespace` names one of the six
[AI Runtime SDK](../sdk/README.md) clients. Onboarding stores both lists as
declared and does not check that `namespace` is one of the six or that the
rApp really calls it. Everything else in the file is descriptive.

| Namespace | Meaning | ES | MO | CO | TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `data` (consumes) | `sdk.data`: DME datasets, cell guards, O1 config read-back | PRB_UTILIZATION, PRB_UTILIZATION_SIM | HO_PERFORMANCE, HO_PERFORMANCE_SIM | COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE, COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE_SIM | LOAD_PERFORMANCE, LOAD_PERFORMANCE_SIM |
| `analytics` (consumes) | `sdk.analytics`: MDAF predictions and reports | MDAF PRB predictions (`get_prediction`) | not used (d) | not used (d) | not used (d) |
| `models` (consumes) | `sdk.models`: register the model, store its artifact in MLMR | EnergySavingPredictor | MobilityRobustnessPredictor | CoverageSensitivityModel | CongestionSteeringModel |
| `lifecycle` (consumes) | `sdk.lifecycle`: AIMgF jobs, MLLF deploy, inference | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `intent` (consumes) | `sdk.intent`: `AutonomyDispatch` of the decision | LOCK recommendations | CIO changes | tilt / power change sets | steering and release steps |
| `platform` (consumes) | `sdk.platform`: SME registration, direct DME O1 actions | wake, rollback, operator override | KPI reverts, rollbacks, DMRO bounds | KPI reverts, rollbacks | KPI reverts, rollbacks |
| `data` (provides) | A dataset the rApp publishes for others | `PRB_UTILIZATION_SIM` (Digital Twin sample producer) | `HO_PERFORMANCE_SIM` | `COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE_SIM` | `LOAD_PERFORMANCE_SIM` |
| other namespaces (provides) | | none (e) | none (e) | none (e) | none (e) |

Why a namespace is not declared:

- **(d) `analytics` in MO, CO and TS.** These rApps derive their features
  from the DME datasets themselves and read no MDAF prediction or report.
  Only ES asks MDAF for a PRB forecast. The declaration matches each rApp's
  code (`sdk.analytics` is called only in `energy-saving-rapp/app/main.py`).
- **(e) `provides`.** The platform defines no SDK surface an rApp can serve
  to others, so the only thing an rApp provides is data, through its own
  Digital Twin producer.

Descriptive-only keys, present in all four rApps. Onboarding ignores all of them:

| Key | Describes | ES | MO | CO | TS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `datasets` | DME types used | PRB_UTILIZATION, _SIM | HO_PERFORMANCE, _SIM | COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE, _SIM | LOAD_PERFORMANCE, _SIM |
| `supportedStages` | Lifecycle stages | four | four | four | four |
| `producedModel` | `{name, type}` of the model | EnergySavingPredictor, REGRESSION | MobilityRobustnessPredictor, CLASSIFICATION_REGRESSION | CoverageSensitivityModel, REGRESSION_OPTIMISATION | CongestionSteeringModel, REGRESSION |
| `inputs` | Counters / attributes read | absent (f) | `MM.Ho*` counters | `MR.*`, `CM.*` | `RRU.PrbTotDl`, `RRC.ConnMean`, `DRB.UEThpDl`, `HO.*`, `CM.*` |
| `outputs` | O1 attributes written | `administrativeState` | `cellIndividualOffset` | `digitalTilt`, `configuredMaxTxPower` | `cellReselectionPriority`, `cellIndividualOffset` |
| `supportedActions` | Actions the rApp can take | `LOCK_CELL`, `UNLOCK_CELL` | `RAISE_CIO`, `LOWER_CIO`, `REVERT_CIO` | `DOWNTILT`, `UPTILT`, `POWER_UP`, `POWER_DOWN`, `REVERT` | `STEER_*`, `RELEASE_*`, `REVERT` |
| `o1Targets` / `o1Attributes` | TS 28.541 classes and attributes it changes | `NRCellDU`, `CESManagementFunction` | `NRCellRelation`, `DMROFunction` | `CommonBeamformingFunction`, `NRSectorCarrier` | `NRFreqRelation`, `NRCellRelation` |
| `supportedVendorModes` | O1 transports | `O1_NETCONF`, `O1_RESTCONF` | same | same | same |
| `supportedAnalytics` | Analytics kinds used | `TRAFFIC_FORECAST` | absent (d) | absent (d) | absent (d) |

- **(f)** ES does not list `inputs`; its manifest names the dataset only
  (`datasets: PRB_UTILIZATION`). The other three enumerate the counters.
- `supportedVendorModes` names the O1 transports the rApp's writes may travel
  over: RAN NF OAM dispatches RFC 6241 `edit-config` (NETCONF) and RFC 8040
  RESTCONF, both over plain HTTP (see
  [`../ran-nf-oam/README.md`](../ran-nf-oam/README.md)).

## 5. Files under `Files/`

| Path | Shape | Used by | Reference rApps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Files/Sme/providers/*.json` | CAPIF `APIProviderEnrolmentDetails` | rApp Management registers it with SME at `bootstrap-complete` | none (g) |
| `Files/Sme/serviceapis/*.json` | CAPIF `ServiceAPIDescription` | as above | none (g) |
| `Files/Sme/invokers/*.json` | CAPIF invoker onboarding body | not read by Onboarding | none (g) |
| `Files/Dme/infoproducers/*.json` | DME type registration (`POST /dme/production-capabilities`) | the rApp at start | none (h) |
| `Files/Dme/infoconsumers/*.json` | DME data job | the rApp at start | none (h) |
| `Files/Acm/definition/compositions.json` | ONAP ACM composition | nothing: the build never calls ONAP ACM | none |

- **(g)** The four rApps ship no SME declarations, so rApp Management has
  nothing to register for them. A package that does ship them is still
  registered with SME at `bootstrap-complete`.
- **(h)** The AI rApps register their DME types from code (for example
  `energy-saving-rapp/app/producer.py` calls `sdk.data.register_type`) instead
  of shipping JSON declarations.

## 6. What fails onboarding

All of these end in `ApplicationPackage.state = FAILED` rather than an HTTP
error from the create call (the answer to `POST /packages` carries the reason as `failureReason`; it is not stored):

| Cause | Source |
|---|---|
| Location does not end in `.csar` | `NamingValidator` check |
| Not a zip, or `TOSCA-Metadata/TOSCA.meta` or the entry definitions file is missing, or no `Entry-Definitions:` line | `_validate_package` |
| Invalid YAML in `manifest.yaml` or `capabilities.yaml` | `_parse_ai_capabilities` |
| Invalid `runtimeProfiles` (§3) | `_validate_runtime_profiles` |
| Invalid `operatorUi` (§3.1): unknown kind, key or version, a `source` that is not a GET, a route with `..`, a limit exceeded, a duplicate id | `smo_shared.operator_ui.validate_operator_ui`, called by `_parse_ai_capabilities`. The message is in `failureReason` of the `202` answer and in the log |
| Malformed JSON under `Files/Sme/` | `_parse_sme_declarations` (`JSONDecodeError`) |
| Location unreachable (HTTP error fetching the CSAR) | `_validate_package` |
| NFO refuses the descriptor | `_create_nf_deployment_descriptor` |

The package signature check is an internal-consistency check, not
verification against a trust anchor (see [`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)).

## 7. Authoring checklist

1. Copy the closest sample. Start from `energy-saving-rapp/`.
2. Give the ASD a new `descriptor_id` / `descriptor_invariant_id`, and set
   `application_name`, `application_version`, `provider`.
3. In `manifest.yaml` list only the modes you implement, and keep every
   `runtimeProfiles` key inside `executionModes`.
4. In `capabilities.yaml` declare exactly the SDK namespaces your code calls. To give the rApp its own operator page, add `operatorUi` to the manifest (§3.1; `smo_sdk.operator_ui` builds and checks it).
5. Rebuild with `python3 samples/build_csar.py <name>` and run
   `PYTHONPATH=shared python -m pytest tests_integration/ -q`.

## 5. A rApp that is not Python (the Java example)

The CSAR does not start the process (§2), so the language of the workload is outside the package; what the platform needs from any rApp is the same.

| Needed | Python sample rApps | Java example (`sdk-java/examples/hello-rapp/`) |
|---|---|---|
| The package | `samples/<name>/`, `python3 samples/build_csar.py <name>` | `package/`, `python3 samples/build_csar.py --source-dir sdk-java/examples/hello-rapp/package --name hello-java-rapp` writes `./hello-java-rapp.csar` (same fixed timestamps, so a rebuild is byte-identical; the CSAR is not committed) |
| The runtime image | one `Dockerfile` for all services, `MODULE=samples/<name>` | `examples/hello-rapp/Dockerfile`: multi-stage, Temurin 21 JDK builds with the Maven wrapper, Temurin 21 JRE (digest-pinned) runs `java -jar hello-rapp.jar` as uid 10001 |
| The service in compose | an entry in `docker-compose.yml` (and the chart) | `examples/hello-rapp/docker-compose.java-rapp.yml`, an override file: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f sdk-java/examples/hello-rapp/docker-compose.java-rapp.yml up -d --build hello-java-rapp`; hardening as the stack's (`cap_drop: ALL`, read-only root, `no-new-privileges`) |
| Identity | `SMO_IDENTITY_KIND=rapp`; enrols on first use | the same variables; or the pair `POST /rapp-mgmt/instances/{id}/credentials` issues, as `SMO_INVOKER_ID` / `SMO_INVOKER_SECRET` |
| Where it is reached | operator API base registered at rApp Management | `PUT /rapp-mgmt/instances/{id}/operator-api` made by the rApp at start; `HELLO_OPERATOR_API_BASE` is the address the gateway reaches the container at |
| Health | `/live`, `/ready` | the same two routes, on the JDK's built-in HTTP server |

The manifest of the Java package has `executionModes: [INFERENCE]` and a small `runtimeProfiles.INFERENCE` (the example trains nothing); its `operatorUi` is the
three-panel page `sdk-java/README.md` describes, and `sdk/tests/test_java_example_package.py` checks it with the code Onboarding runs. The example is not in the Helm chart.
