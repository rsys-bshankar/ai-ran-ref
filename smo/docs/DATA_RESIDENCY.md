# Data residency: where data lives, and what leaves a site

One page for an operator deciding where to run this and what to allow out (`STD-6.1`). Written from the compose file, the Helm chart and the code (October 2026). The platform has no
cloud component of its own: everything below runs where you start it. Personal data in particular is inventoried in [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Where data lives

| Data | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Every module's state: managed entities, alarms, performance files, configuration jobs and snapshots, models, intents, SME registrations, the outbox, the platform audit chain (`audit_log`), `module_identity` credentials | **Postgres 18**, volume `smo_pgdata` in compose; the database of the Helm release (a PVC, or CloudNativePG in the HA lab) | One database, one schema per module (`DB-2`). Postgres can be an external service: `SMO_DATABASE_URL`, `SMO_DB_HOST` |
| GUI users, the GUI audit log, failed-login counters, revoked sessions, the session signing key (when `GUI_JWT_SECRET` is unset), the BFF's SME credential, the first-start admin password file | **SQLite file on volume `gui_bff_data`** (`GUI_DATABASE_URL`, default `sqlite:////data/gui-bff.db`); any SQLAlchemy URL works | Not in Postgres and not in the `db_backup.sh` dump; the compose `db-backup` service copies it into each off-site set (`docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`), nothing does on Kubernetes. Replicas of the BFF need one shared `GUI_DATABASE_URL` |
| Onboarded rApp packages (CSAR files) | volume `smo_packages` (`/srv/packages`, Onboarding) | |
| CSAR files an operator copies in to be served by location | volume `smo_scratch` (`/srv/scratch`, R1 Termination) | |
| Scratch space | `/tmp` of each container: memory, gone on restart (the root filesystem is read-only) | |
| Secrets | files in `secrets/` on the Docker host (`db_password`, `enrollment_secret`, `tls_cert`, `tls_key`), mounted into the containers; Kubernetes Secrets in Helm | `docs/SECRETS.md` lists each one and whether it is stored as a hash or in plaintext |
| Backups | wherever the operator puts them: `scripts/db_backup.sh` writes `smo/backups/smo-<UTC>.dump` (mode 0600) on the host that runs it | Off-site copies: with `scripts/dr_backup.sh` (compose service `db-backup`, profile `backup`) every database dump, the GUI SQLite file and a manifest go to the S3-compatible bucket named by `SMO_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`, which can be in another country than the site; with CloudNativePG `postgres.cnpgBackup` and the cluster's `barmanObjectStore` send the WAL and base backups to the bucket the operator names. Choose its region with `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md` in mind. Nothing is sent unless one of those is configured |
| Logs | stdout of each container, as the container runtime keeps them; no log shipper is installed (`OBS-6`, not built) | Structured logs carry route templates and correlation ids, not raw paths or queries; the GUI web server's access log carries client IP addresses and request paths (`PRIVACY.md`, rows 15 and 16) |
| Container images | the registry the deployment pulls from. Compose builds from the checkout; Helm pulls `ghcr.io/rsys-bshankar/ai-ran-smo/smo-<name>:<tag>` (value `image.registry`) | Pinned base images by digest: Postgres, nginx, Python, node |
| Performance data content, alarm text | inside Postgres (`pm_file.content`, `alarm`), as the network sent it | The platform does not inspect it (`PRIVACY.md`, section 1) |

## What leaves a site

Everything in this table is initiated by the platform at run time. Nothing else is: **there is no telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, licence check or update check in the code**
(searched: no client for any such service; the GUI loads no external script, font or image and its content security policy allows `self` only; OpenTelemetry export is not built, `OBS-3`).

| What | Where to | When | Controlled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Notifications to caller-registered URLs** (outbox: DME, SME, AIMgF, FOCOM, MDAF, Intent Service, RAN NF OAM; and the two inline reads, a producer's health URL and an O1 adaptor's `/capabilities`) | The URL the subscriber registered: anywhere the subscriber chose. The payload is what the module puts in the notification | On the event, with retries (5 attempts, backoff) | The callers who register destinations. `smo_shared.webhook` refuses non-http(s) URLs and literal loopback, link-local (including the cloud metadata address), multicast and reserved addresses, at registration and again at send time. It does not resolve names, so a hostname that resolves to such an address passes (`MSG-6`), and every other host, private ranges included, is allowed: there is no allow-list of destination hosts. `docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md` lists every call site |
| **Package download** | The `location` URL of a package an operator or rApp asks Onboarding to onboard (`.csar`, 30 s timeout, same URL guard) | On onboarding | Who may call it (operator in the GUI) |
| **O1 southbound** | The adaptor or network element registered as an `o1_adaptor_endpoint`: NETCONF over SSH (port as registered) or over TLS with a client certificate, or RESTCONF over plain HTTP, and the adaptor's HTTP endpoint for the legacy transport | When a configuration job, software-management job or CM read runs | The endpoints an admin registers; the credentials by reference (`docs/SECRETS.md`) |
| **O2 southbound** | **None today.** FOCOM keeps its own inventory and provisioning records, and NFO instantiates nothing on a real cluster: neither makes an outbound O2 call | – | – |
| **Kubernetes API** | The cluster's own API server, only with `RAPP_CREDENTIAL_DELIVERY=kubernetes` (Helm `rappCredentials.delivery`): rApp Management writes a Secret per rApp instance | On instance create, rotate and terminate | The Helm value |
| **Image pulls** | The registry named above (GHCR for the released images), and, when building from the checkout, Docker Hub for base images, PyPI (hash-locked, `requirements/`), the Debian mirror (one `apt-get` in the `Dockerfile`) and the npm registry (GUI build) | At pull or build time, not at run time | The operator's registry mirror and network policy |
| **Signatures and provenance** | Nothing leaves a site to verify an image: the cosign signature, the SLSA provenance and the SBOM sit in the registry beside each image (`.github/workflows/release-images.yml`; signing is keyless, so the signature names that workflow as signer). Verifying them is an operator step against the registry and the public Sigstore services | At release (CI), and when an operator verifies | The operator |
| **Postgres and Prometheus** | Postgres `:5432` is published on the host in compose (`SECURITY.md`); each module's `/metrics` is for a scraper on the container network and is not served by the TLS edge | – | The operator |

## What an operator controls

- **Where it runs.** Nothing in the stack needs an Internet connection to run once the images and the database exist. An air-gapped site mirrors the images and sets `image.registry`.
- **What is published.** Compose publishes R1 `:8080`, the GUI `:3000` and Postgres `:5432`; the `tls` profile adds `:8443` and `:3443`. Unpublish the plain ports and Postgres for anything but a laptop.
- **Which destinations can be called.** Only by deciding who may register a notification URL or an O1 endpoint (RBAC in the GUI; at R1 an rApp may register subscriptions, not O1 endpoints). A network egress policy is the real boundary: the platform's own URL guard is a safeguard, not an allow-list.
- **Retention.** Built for alarms, PM files, safeguard refusals, MDAF reports and the GUI audit log, and off until the operator sets a number of days: `docs/RETENTION.md`. Other tables: see `PRIVACY.md` section 2. Otherwise the operator deletes what must go.
- **Backups and logs**, their location (the off-site bucket included, `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`), encryption and expiry; the platform writes them in plain files and standard output.
- **Region.** The platform has no notion of data region or tenant in its data model (`SEC-10.2` would add `region` and `tenant` to `managed_entity`, not built); a deployment per region is the way to keep data in one.
