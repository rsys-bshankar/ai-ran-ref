# Personal data: inventory and erasure of a GUI user

Where this platform can hold or write personal data, how long it keeps it, who can read it, how it leaves, and how a GUI user is erased (`STD-4.1`, `STD-4.3`). Written from the
models, migrations and code of this repository; where something is not implemented the row says so and names the `OPEN_ITEMS.md` item that would implement it. It is an engineering
inventory, not legal advice or a data-protection impact assessment: it does not decide the legal basis, the retention a law requires, or what an operator's contract says.

## 1. What kind of data there is

- **Operator staff.** The platform is a management plane. The people it knows are the operators who use the GUI (username, a password hash, a role) and the name or identifier that is written
  next to what they did (who acknowledged an alarm, who asked for a configuration change, who rejected a dispatch).
- **Subscribers (end users of the network): none by design.** No model in any module has a column for a subscriber, device or UE identifier (`IMSI`, `SUPI`, `MSISDN`, `IMEI`, a UE id):
  checked in the models of every module. Performance data is counters per managed element and cell; alarms are per managed object. Two columns have "subscriber" in their name and are
  not about people: `service_event_subscription.subscriber_id` (SME: the invoker that subscribed to CAPIF events) and `mdaf_report.subscriber_attribution` (a column nothing writes or reads).
  What the platform **cannot** promise is the content of what a real network sends it. Two places keep that content as opaque text and do not inspect it: `pm_file.content` (RAN NF OAM)
  and the free text of an alarm (`specific_problem`, additional text). If a deployed RAN puts subscriber-level data in a performance file or an alarm text, it is stored as sent. **Not assessed**
  against a real RAN (none has been connected); the demo data is synthetic.
- **IP addresses.** The application tables store none. The GUI's web server writes one per request in its access log (section 3, "Logs").

## 2. Inventory

Roles in "who can read": **admin / operator / viewer** are the GUI roles (`gui-bff/app/rbac.py`; every read under a module prefix is open to `viewer` and above except the rows
`rbac.py` raises to operator or admin); **rApp** is any valid SME token (reads at R1 are open to every valid token, scoping them per tenant is `SEC-10`); **DB role** is whoever holds a
database role that can read the schema (each module has its own role, `DB-2.7` done; the `smo` role and the Postgres superuser read all).

Retention "none" means there is no deletion in the code at all.

| # | Item | Table / column or field | Module | Purpose | Retention today | Who can read | How it leaves the system |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GUI user account | `gui_user`: `username` (primary key; for a user of the OIDC provider `oidc:<subject>`, the provider's pseudonymous identifier, which the BFF takes from the ID token and which identifies the person at that provider), `password_hash` (scrypt, N=2^14 r=8 p=1, 16-byte salt; `!` for an OIDC user: no password is stored), `role`, `active`, `token_version`, `break_glass` (an admin's flag, PR-SEC-7.7), `created_at` | GUI BFF (SQLite on volume `gui_bff_data`, default `GUI_DATABASE_URL`) | Sign-in and role checks | Until an admin deletes the user (section 4) | admin (`GET /api/admin/users`: username, role, active, created; the hash is never returned); the volume's owner | The volume; **not in `scripts/db_backup.sh`** (section 3, "Backups") |
| 2 | Failed-login counter | `gui_login_failure`: `username` as typed (a real name, an unknown name, or whatever the person typed in the field), `count`, `first_failed_at` | GUI BFF | Account lockout (5 failures in 300 s) | None: a row is cleared by that name's next successful sign-in, and otherwise stays. Rows for names that never sign in accumulate | The volume's owner. No route reads it | The volume |
| 3 | Revoked session | `gui_revoked_session`: `jti` (random token id), `expires_at`. No username | GUI BFF | A logout ends that token | Until the token would have expired (8 h by default), removed the next time anyone logs out | The volume's owner. Not personal data by itself | The volume |
| 4 | GUI audit log | `gui_audit_log`: `at`, `username` (the actor, or the name typed on a failed login), `role`, `action` (`LOGIN`, `OIDC_LOGIN`, `OIDC_LOGIN_FAILED`, `TOKEN`, `LOGOUT`, `LOGIN_FAILED`, `LOGIN_LOCKED`, `LOGIN_REFUSED`, `MFA_CHALLENGE`, `BREAK_GLASS_LOGIN`, `RECOVERY_CODE_USED`, `PASSWORD_CHANGED`, `TOTP_ENROL_STARTED`, `TOTP_ENROLLED`, `RECOVERY_CODES_REGENERATED`, `TOTP_RESET`, `USER_CREATED`, `USER_UPDATED`, `USER_DELETED`, `USER_SESSIONS_REVOKED`, `DENIED`, `PROXY`; never a code, a secret or a recovery code), `method`, `path` (the proxied path **with its query string**, e.g. `?ack_user_id=<name>`), `status_code`, `detail` (for user administration: the target username and what changed) | GUI BFF | Who did what through the GUI | Append-only: the ORM refuses to update or delete a row. **Optional purge** (`GUI_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 0 = none), with an export of the rows first (`GUI_AUDIT_EXPORT_DIR`); `docs/RETENTION.md` | admin (`GET /api/admin/audit`, filter by `username` and `action`); the volume's owner | The volume; admin's API read. Exported only by the purge's export-before-delete (`python -m app.retention`); `SEC-11.5` covers the platform log below |
| 5 | Platform audit chain | `audit_log`: `actor` (the SME invoker id the gateway vouches for), `actor_role`, `action` (HTTP method), `target` (module prefix and path, **no query, no body**), `result`, `correlation_id`, `detail` (`{"onBehalfOf": ...}` for an internal caller that names the rApp it acts for); `audit_head` | R1 Termination writes; `smo_shared/audit.py` | Tamper-evident record of changes through the gateway | None: "rows are not purged; retention is by archiving an export" (`audit.py`). Retention is by export (`docs/RETENTION.md`) | DB roles that read `public.audit_log`; not through the GUI (merging it into the GUI's view is `SEC-11.6`, open) | `python -m smo_shared.audit export` (JSON lines, RFC 5424 syslog), which the operator runs |
| 6 | GUI user name inside module records | The GUI pins the signed-in user into the request as `smo-gui:<username>` (`requestedBy`, `rejectedBy`, `operator`) or as the plain username (`ack_user_id`, `clear_user_id`) before it forwards it. Columns: `write_config_job.requested_by`, `rapp_kill.killed_by`, `dme_action_record.requested_by`, `autonomy_dispatch.rejected_by`, `energy_saving_cell.override_by` (the sample rApp), `alarm.ack_user_id`, `alarm.clear_user_id` | RAN NF OAM, DME, Intent Service, the Energy Saving sample | Accountability of an operator action | None. Alarms, jobs and records have no purge (`DB-3.3`, `DB-3.4`; the `safeguard_refusal` purge is by age, below) | Every GUI role through the proxy (viewer and above can read alarms and jobs); every rApp token (reads are open); DB roles | API responses; backups; the outbox if a module puts the field in a notification (not found in a static search, not assessed per payload) |
| 7 | Free-text person fields | Whatever a caller writes: `ran_nf_oam.o1_adaptor_host_key.pinned_by` (a body field `pinnedBy`), `aimgf.certification_record.decided_by` (the `decided_by` query parameter of `POST /aimgf/models/{id}/advance`), `mdaf.mda_subscription.requested_by`, `mdaf.mda_request.requested_by`, `safeguard_refusal.requested_by`, `dme` and `mlmr` `owner`, `mlmr` `author` (an `owner` or `author` is whatever the registering caller names: a person or a system) | RAN NF OAM, AIMgF, MDAF, DME, MLMR | Attribution | None | As row 6 | As row 6 |
| 8 | MSAC identity | `msac_identity` (TS 28.319 `Identity`: `identity_name`, `identity_type`, `credential_hash`, a role list; a name can be a person's) | RAN NF OAM | Access control of configuration writes | Until deleted through the API (as far as the routes go: not exercised for this inventory) | Identity names: every reader; the credential is a hash and never returned | As row 6 |
| 9 | Notification outbox | `notification_outbox`: `destination` (a caller-supplied URL, which can contain a name or a token), `payload` (JSON), `last_error` | every module through `smo_shared/outbox.py` | At-least-once delivery of notifications | `SENT` rows: removed after `SMO_OUTBOX_SENT_RETENTION_SECONDS` (default 86400 s). `PENDING` and `DEAD` rows: **never removed** | DB roles | To the registered destination (that is the purpose); backups |
| 10 | Idempotency record | the stored answer of a command with an `Idempotency-Key` (`smo_shared/idempotency.py`), including the response body, per caller (invoker id) | modules that use `@idempotent` | Replay of a repeated command | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 86400 s), purged when the same key is next used | DB roles | The replayed answer to the same caller |
| 11 | Configuration history | `cm_snapshot`, `write_config_job`, `write_config_sub_change` (before and after images of what a job changed; the job's `requested_by` is row 6) | RAN NF OAM | Rollback and CM history | Snapshots: `RAN_NF_OAM_CM_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 0, keep) with `POST /config-history/purge`, only when someone calls it. Jobs: none | As row 6 | As row 6 |
| 12 | Safeguard refusals | `safeguard_refusal` (`invoker_id`, `requested_by`, `code`, `detail`) | RAN NF OAM | Records of an rApp's refused requests | `SAFEGUARD_REFUSAL_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 0, keep); when set, the worker purges daily; `POST /safeguard-refusals/purge` | internal callers only at R1; DB roles | Outbox notifications to safeguard subscribers |
| 13 | Session token in the browser | Cookie `smo_session` (HS256 JWT: `sub` = username or `oidc:<subject>`, `ver`, `csrf`, `jti`, `exp`) and `smo_csrf` | GUI BFF, the operator's browser | The session | `GUI_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (default 8 h); ended by logout (row 3) | The browser; it is `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` | Sent back to the BFF only |
| 14 | First-start admin password | file `GUI_INITIAL_PASSWORD_FILE` (mode 0600, volume `gui_bff_data`) when `GUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is unset | GUI BFF | Bootstrap | Until the operator deletes it (the log tells them to) | the volume's owner | The volume |
| 15 | Service logs | JSON on stdout: `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `service`, `correlationId`, and for each request the method, the **route template** (never the raw path or query), status and duration (`smo_shared/logconfig.py`); a redaction filter removes credentials. One module log line names a person: RAN NF OAM's warning when a host key is replaced (`pinnedBy`) | every module on the shared image | Operation | The container runtime's log policy (Docker's default driver does not rotate): the operator's | the operator (`docker compose logs`, the log shipper) | The shipper the operator installs (`OBS-6`, not built here) |
| 16 | GUI web server log | nginx's default access log on stdout of the `gui` container (no `access_log` directive): client IP address, time, the **request line including the path** (for example `DELETE /api/admin/users/<username>`), status, user agent | `gui` (nginx) and the TLS edge `edge-tls` | Operation | The container runtime's log policy | the operator | As row 15 |
| 17 | Slow-statement log | Postgres `log_min_duration_statement` (default 500 ms): the statement text, and with it any bound parameter the server logs for that statement, so a slow statement can contain a username | Postgres | Slow query diagnosis | Postgres container log policy | the operator | As row 15 |
| 18 | Database backups | `scripts/db_backup.sh`: one `pg_dump` custom-format file with every Postgres table (rows 5 to 12 above), mode 0600 | operator | Recovery | The operator's: nothing deletes `backups/` | whoever can read the file | Wherever the operator copies it; with `scripts/dr_backup.sh` the S3-compatible bucket named by `SMO_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`, where `SMO_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14, at least `SMO_BACKUP_KEEP_MIN` sets) deletes old sets (`docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`) |
| 19 | OIDC sign-in in flight | `gui_oidc_login`: `state`, `nonce`, the PKCE code verifier, the SHA-256 of a browser-binding value, `expires_at`; the cookie `smo_oidc` (the binding value itself, HttpOnly, ten minutes, `Path=/api/oidc`). Random values only: no name, no claim from the provider | GUI BFF | A sign-in with the OIDC provider | Deleted when the callback arrives; expired rows (ten minutes) removed whenever another sign-in starts | The volume's owner. Not personal data | The volume |
| 20 | One-time-code secret of a local account | `gui_user_totp`: `username` (primary key), `secret_enc` (the TOTP secret encrypted with AES-256-GCM under `GUI_TOTP_KEY`, the user name as associated data; **the secret itself is not stored**), `confirmed`, `last_step` (the time step of the last code accepted), `created_at`, `confirmed_at`. The secret is an authentication credential of the person, not a description of them | GUI BFF | A second factor at sign-in (PR-SEC-7) | Until an admin resets the code or deletes the user (section 4); an unconfirmed enrolment stays until it is confirmed, replaced or reset | The volume's owner; the secret is readable only with the key, which is outside the database (`GUI_TOTP_KEY` / `_FILE`). No route returns it after the enrolment answer | The volume (and its backups: a backup without the key holds nothing usable; with the key it holds the secrets); **the enrolment answer shows the secret and the `otpauth://` link once, to the signed-in person** |
| 21 | Recovery codes of a local account | `gui_recovery_code`: `username`, `code_hash` (HMAC-SHA256 under a key derived from `GUI_TOTP_KEY`, over the user name and the code; the code is not stored), `used_at` | GUI BFF | A way in when the device is lost (PR-SEC-7.3) | Until replaced (new codes replace all), reset by an admin, or the user is deleted (section 4); a spent row stays until then | The volume's owner. No route reads it | The volume. **The ten codes are shown once, at the confirmation, to the signed-in person** |
| 22 | Sign-in challenge | `gui_login_challenge`: `jti` (random), `username`, `expires_at` (five minutes). The browser holds the signed token for it between the password and the code | GUI BFF | The second step of a sign-in (PR-SEC-7.2) | Deleted by the correct code; expired rows removed whenever another challenge is written; deleted with the user or at a reset | The volume's owner. No route reads it | The volume |

Not personal data, listed so nobody searches for it: `gui_setting` (session signing key), `gui_smo_credential` and `module_identity` (service credentials, `docs/SECRETS.md`), invoker
registrations at SME (names of rApps and modules), and `jti` values.

## 3. Findings the inventory turned up

These are facts about the current build; each is either tracked in `OPEN_ITEMS.md` or says what is missing.

- **The GUI audit log is not hash-chained.** `gui_audit_log` is append-only because the ORM refuses an update or delete (`AuditEntry`, a `before_flush` listener); the database itself has no trigger or
  chain, so someone with write access to the SQLite file, or a statement that bypasses the ORM, can change a row undetected. The tamper-evident chain (`audit_log`, `smo_shared/audit.py`) records
  gateway changes by invoker id, and a GUI action reaches it as a call by the GUI's own SME invoker, not by the person (the person is in `gui_audit_log` only). Tracked: `STD-4.7`.
- **The BFF database is in the off-site set on compose only.** `scripts/db_backup.sh` dumps Postgres. GUI users, the GUI audit log and the failed-login counters are in the SQLite file on `gui_bff_data`;
  `scripts/dr_backup.sh` (the `db-backup` service) copies it into each set with SQLite's backup API, and the runbook puts it back (`docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`). On Kubernetes nothing copies it: use a shared `GUI_DATABASE_URL` or snapshot the volume.
  An erased GUI user stays in every older set until retention deletes it.
- **Person names are written in two ways that erasure cannot reach.** `smo-gui:<username>` and `ack_user_id` are copied into module tables (row 6), and several attribution fields are free text
  from the caller (row 7). Two of them are not pinned to the signed-in user: `decided_by` on `advance` (certification and approvals of AI/ML models) and `pinnedBy` of a host key. A
  signed-in operator can attribute either to any name. Tracked: `STD-4.6`.
- **A deleted user could come back through an old token.** Before this change a new user created under a deleted name started at `token_version` 0 and so accepted the previous holder's unexpired
  token. Fixed (section 4): a new user starts at a random version.
- **Rows for typed names accumulate** (row 2), and a person who types a password into the username field leaves it in `gui_login_failure` and `gui_audit_log.username`. Retention for both is `DB-3.6` and
  `STD-4.2`; nothing deletes them today.
- **Reads are broad.** A viewer can read alarms (with `ack_user_id`) and every configuration job (with `requested_by`); an rApp token can read the same. Per-tenant and per-region scoping is `SEC-10`; the logging of personal-data reads is `STD-4.4`.

## 4. Erasure of a GUI user (`STD-4.3`)

### What the procedure does today

An admin calls `DELETE /api/admin/users/{username}` (the GUI: Admin, Users, delete). In one database transaction (`gui-bff/app/main.py`, `delete_user`):

| Removed | How |
|---|---|
| The account (`gui_user` row: username, password hash, role) | `DELETE` |
| The failed-login counter kept under that name (`gui_login_failure`) | `DELETE` in the same transaction (before this change it stayed) |
| The one-time-code secret, recovery codes and open sign-in challenges (`gui_user_totp`, `gui_recovery_code`, `gui_login_challenge`; rows 20 to 22) | `DELETE` straight after the account's transaction (`reset_totp`, PR-SEC-7); an admin's "reset one-time code" does the same without deleting the account |
| Every session of the user, in a browser or as a script token | There is no session row: a session is a signed token naming the user. With the user row gone, every token naming it is refused (`401 SESSION_REVOKED`) on its next use, whichever instance serves it. A new account under the same name starts at a random `token_version`, so the old tokens stay refused |

Refused: deleting yourself (`409 CANNOT_DELETE_SELF`); deleting the last active admin (`409 LAST_ADMIN`). Deleting a user that does not exist answers 204. The call is itself audited:
`USER_DELETED`, with the username as `detail`, so the audit log gains one more row that names the person.

Tried once, end to end: `gui-bff/tests/test_main.py::test_erasing_a_gui_user_end_to_end_and_what_it_leaves_behind` creates a user, signs in by cookie and by script token, acknowledges an alarm
through the proxy, ends a third session, fails two logins, deletes the user through the admin route and asserts: the user row and the failed-login row are gone, both sessions are refused, the
name cannot sign in, a user re-created under the name does not revive either token, the audit rows naming the user are all still there, the revocation row holds only a token id and an expiry,
and the ORM refuses to edit an audit row.

### What it does not remove, and why

| Remains | Where | Why | Options |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit rows naming the user | `gui_audit_log.username` and `.detail` (including the `USER_CREATED` / `USER_DELETED` rows and the query string `ack_user_id=<name>` in `path`) | The log is append-only by design, to keep who-did-what trustworthy. The BFF's guard refuses an edit. **This log is not hash-chained** (section 3), so the constraint is policy and the ORM guard, not cryptography | (a) **Keep, with a justification** (security and accountability records, kept for the audit retention period, then deleted): needs retention (`DB-3.6`) and a written period. (b) **Pseudonymise at write time**: write an opaque per-user id (for example a random id stored on `gui_user`) in place of the name, with the mapping in `gui_user`, so deleting the user severs the link and the rows stay as they are. Not built: `STD-4.5`. (c) Rewrite the rows of one user by SQL under change control and add an audit row saying so: possible on this log only because it is not chained, and it breaks the log's append-only claim; not recommended |
| The same user in the platform `audit_log` | does not apply to the GUI user: the actor there is the GUI's SME invoker id, and the request body and query are never recorded | The chain: each row's hash covers its fields and the previous hash, the rows are numbered by `audit_head`, so an edited row breaks its own hash, a deleted row breaks the numbering and the next link, and a removed tail no longer matches the head (`audit.py`). A row therefore **cannot be edited or removed without `python -m smo_shared.audit verify` failing**, and re-hashing every later row is not detected by the chain alone unless the head was anchored elsewhere | If a person's identifier ever reaches this log (for example in `detail.onBehalfOf`), the only options are the two above: pseudonymise at write time (the actor and `onBehalfOf` hold an opaque id), or keep with justification and archive by export. Rewriting the chain means a new chain and a new anchor, and is a breach of the log's purpose |
| The user's name in module tables (section 2, rows 6 and 7) | `write_config_job.requested_by`, `rapp_kill.killed_by`, `dme_action_record.requested_by`, `autonomy_dispatch.rejected_by`, `alarm.ack_user_id` / `clear_user_id`, the sample rApp's `override_by`, and the free-text fields | There is no route that erases or rewrites them, and no retention that would remove the rows (`DB-3`) | Pseudonymise at write time (`STD-4.5`), or an operator rewrites the value with SQL as the module's role, for example `UPDATE <module schema>.write_config_job SET requested_by = 'smo-gui:erased' WHERE requested_by = 'smo-gui:<username>'`. These tables are ordinary rows, not a chain, so a rewrite does not break a verification; **no such statement has been tried here and none is tested** |
| `gui_revoked_session` rows | token id and expiry only | Not personal data by itself; removed after the token's expiry | none needed |
| Backups and log files | the dump files, container logs, the GUI web server's access log (which names the user in the path of the delete and update calls) | Outside the application | The operator's backup and log retention (`SMO_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` for the off-site sets); erasing from a backup is not supported by `scripts/db_restore.sh` or `dr_backup.sh`; after a restore from a set older than an erasure, repeat the erasure |

### The order for an operator

1. Decide, per the table above, whether the audit rows are kept (with a stated period) or are to be rewritten. Today only "keep" is supported by the product.
2. Deactivate first if the person must stop signing in immediately and the account is to be examined: `PATCH /api/admin/users/{username}` with `{"active": false}` ends every session at once.
3. `DELETE /api/admin/users/{username}`.
4. Search the module tables for the name (`smo-gui:<username>` and the plain username in `alarm`), and rewrite or keep them as decided.
5. Note that the web server log and any backup still name the person.

## 5. What is planned

| Item | ID |
|---|---|
| Retention per item, linked to the purge work | `STD-4.2` with `DB-3.1` to `DB-3.8` (including `DB-3.6`, the GUI audit log with export before delete) |
| Pseudonymise GUI usernames at write time (audit log and module tables), or a documented, tested SQL procedure per table | `STD-4.5` |
| Pin `decided_by` and `pinnedBy` to the signed-in user | `STD-4.6` |
| A tamper-evident GUI audit log (chain it, or write it into the platform chain) and its view | `STD-4.7`, `SEC-11.6` |
| Access logging for reads of personal data | `STD-4.4` with `SEC-11.2` |
| Back up and restore the GUI database | `DB-6.5` |
| No local passwords at all: OIDC is built (the user is created on first sign-in with no password, `SEC-6`, 0.5.0); what remains is `GUI_LOCAL_LOGIN_ENABLED=false` in a deployment that wants no break-glass password, and reading an e-mail or display name from the provider is deliberately not done | `SEC-6` (done), operator choice |
| Per-tenant and per-region read scoping | `SEC-10` |
