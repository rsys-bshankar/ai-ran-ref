"""NFO (Network Function Orchestrator): deployment descriptors and the lifecycle of NF deployments, as the O2-DMS-style
service of the SMO.

Where it sits: one FastAPI app behind R1 Termination at `/nfo`. Callers are AIMgF (model runtimes), rApp Management, SO SMOS,
SA SMOS (heal), Onboarding (descriptors) and the GUI. It makes one outgoing call: `GET /focom/inventory` in `instantiate`,
to learn the O-Cloud id for placement. The design records are `HISTORY.md` §5 (the deployment state machine and guards) and
`OI-3-nfo-abnormal` (asynchronous terminate); the NFO + FOCOM LLD sections 2 and 4 describe the flows.

What it owns: descriptors, deployments and their state (`statemachine.py`), the operation history and the resource link
rows. It deploys nothing for real: Instantiate, Scale and the default Terminate complete in the same request instead of
driving Helm (the "Phase 1 elision" comments mark each place). The deployment manager reports how an asynchronous
terminate ends through `receive_dms_notification`.

Before editing: every state change goes through `NFO_FSM.fire`, so a new transition belongs in `statemachine.py` first.
`NFDeployment` is versioned, so two concurrent writers give one of them a 409 CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION. The docstrings of
the routes and request models are published in `docs/openapi/nfo.json`.
