"""Tests of the asynchronous Terminate and of the deployment manager's notifications (`OI-3-nfo-abnormal`): the path through
TERMINATING and DELETING, the failures that make a deployment ABNORMAL, and Heal and Terminate as the ways out.

Run: `cd smo/nfo && PYTHONPATH=.:../shared python -m pytest tests/test_dms_lifecycle.py -q`. Uses the `client`,
