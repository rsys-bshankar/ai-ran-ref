"""Shared fixtures for cross-service integration tests.

Loads every module (and the mock O1 adaptor) into one process
via loader.py, wires every one to ONE shared test-DB engine — matching
the real deployment's one-shared-Postgres-instance topology (Requirements
v0.1 section 3) — and installs the in-process service mesh so R1Client

out over a real network.

    cross-service call chain three deep (so-smos -> nfo -> focom, each a
    real nested FastAPI request) means three separate Session objects
    live at once, all funneled onto this engine's one StaticPool
    connection (smo_shared/testing.py). Each grabbing its OWN
    transaction on that one physical connection is a real bug, caught by
    a genuine `StaleDataError` on a second real cross-service order

    outer Session's not-yet-committed work too (invisible with
    pysqlite's legacy auto-transaction behavior, until testing.py's own
    pysqlite fix turned it into an outright `OperationalError`, "cannot
    start a transaction within a transaction" — confirming this, not a
    proper fix on its own). Every Session in this test — whether `mesh`'s
    own per-request ones or a test's own direct `Session(bind=
    db_connection, join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint")` peek —
    must bind to THIS connection so they all share the one real
    transaction via SAVEPOINT nesting (SQLAlchemy's own documented fix
    for this shape of fixture): a nested Session's own commit then only
    releases its savepoint, never an outer Session's still-open work.
    Confirmed this was purely a test-harness artifact, not a real app
    bug: the identical sequence already passes against a real local
    Postgres instance, where every Session gets its own real connection.

    reloading them per test would just be wasted work. See
    `db_connection`'s own docstring for why every per-request Session
    binds to that one shared connection rather than `shared_engine`
    directly.

    `expire_on_commit=False` closes a second, subtler bug the savepoint
    fix alone didn't: SQLAlchemy's default `expire_on_commit=True` means
    any attribute read on an outer Session's object AFTER its own
    commit() (e.g. rapp-mgmt's `terminate_instance` building a URL from
    `inst.package_id` right after committing `inst.state`) silently
    starts a SECOND implicit transaction on that Session — a new,
    unreleased savepoint. If a nested cross-service call then commits
    (releasing ITS OWN savepoint into that still-open second one) before
    the outer Session is closed, `Session.close()`'s own implicit
    rollback of that never-explicitly-committed second savepoint takes
    the nested commit down with it — silently, no exception, the nested
    write just never happened as far as any later Session can see. Caught
    the same way as the fix above: confirmed purely a test-harness
    artifact (the identical onboarding-prime/deprime/terminate sequence
    passes against a real local Postgres instance) before fixing it here.
