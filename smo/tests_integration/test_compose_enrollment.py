"""PR-SEC-14: the compose file gives every SMO module the enrollment secret, and no rApp.

A module that registers at SME without the secret is recorded as an rApp, is refused the internal scope and cannot call its peers: the whole stack
fails to come ready. `docker compose config` accepts that mistake (it did once: a service written as `environment: *db_env` was missed by a scripted
edit), so this reads the resolved file.
