"""PR-DB-2.5/2.6: a module's tables live in a schema of its own, and its role can use that and nothing else.

The manifest tests need no database. The rest need SMO_TEST_POSTGRES_URL (CI's `migration-postgres` job, or a local server): they migrate a
fresh database to head, run scripts/db_roles.py with a password file, and connect as the module's role.
