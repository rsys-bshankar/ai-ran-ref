"""The CHECK constraints on the status columns of CM jobs admit every state the code puts there (revision 0026).

The unit tests run on SQLite, which does not carry these constraints, so a state the code uses and the constraint lacks only shows on Postgres:
a staged job (`HALTED`, between waves) failed with a 500 on its first pause from 0.2.0 until 0026. These tests migrate a database and check
the constraints against the states of the code, and then put a job through each state.
