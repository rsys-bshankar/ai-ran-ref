"""Every route is behind the R1 gateway's token check (PR-QA-6.1).

No backend service checks a token itself: R1 Termination introspects the bearer token on every proxied request
and is the one enforcement point (`smo_shared/openapi_security.py`). So the question "is any route open?" has
two halves, both walked here from the apps' real route tables:

  1. R1 Termination's own explicit routes are exactly its four public ones; everything else falls to the
     catch-all proxy, which authorises.
  2. For every route of every backend, a request through the gateway with no token, an empty token, a non-bearer
     scheme or an inactive token is refused with 401 and never reaches the backend; with an active token it does.

`unauthenticated_routes` is the walker; a toy gateway with one seeded open path proves it finds one.
