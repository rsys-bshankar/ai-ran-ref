"""Drops the compatibility views `0023`, `0024` and `0025` left in `public` when the module tables moved into schemas of their own (PR-DB-2).

Each of those revisions moved a module's tables with `ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA` and left an updatable view of the same name behind, "for the previous release's code,
until the revision after the next release" (docs/adr/0001-schema-migrations.md): the code of 0.3.0 names its tables without a schema and found them through `public`.
This is that revision. The previous release now is 0.4.0, whose modules connect as their own roles with the module's schema first on the search path
(`scripts/db_roles.py`) and never read the views (`scripts/check_previous_release_code.sh` has said so since 0.4.0), so nothing the rolling upgrade or the rollback
to 0.4.0 needs is removed. What does stop working: a connection that names a module table with no schema as the database owner (a script of the operator's, `psql` as
`smo`, the code of 0.3.0). Name the schema (`onboarding.application_package`) or connect as the module's role.

Which views go is read from the catalogue and not from a list: a view in `public` that depends on a base table of the same name in another schema, which is exactly
what the three revisions made and nothing else. The downgrade makes them again for every base table outside `public`, with the columns the tables had when the views were made (a column a later revision added is left out, as it was then).

The tables the previous release's code uses that are not moved (the A1 tables, `a1_ei_type` and the others, used by 0.4.0's `a1-related` module) are not touched:
they go in the revision after the next release.
