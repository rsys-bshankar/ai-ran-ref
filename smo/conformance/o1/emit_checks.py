"""The emitting checks of the O1 adaptor kit (PR-SB-9b): groups FM, PM (and FILE), SW and HB.

These run the other way from checks.py: the adaptor sends alarms, PM reports and files, software-management phase results and heartbeats to RAN NF OAM. There is no
standard way to ask an adaptor to do that, so the kit uses a trigger API (`POST <emit-url>/emit/<kind>`, the one `mock-o1-adaptor` implements), and every check then reads
RAN NF OAM's own state: a trigger that answers "emitted" and sends nothing fails the read-back. A group is skipped when the adaptor does not declare its service in
`/capabilities`, or when no `--oam-url` was given (kit.run).

The kit prepares what RAN NF OAM needs once per run and caches it in `ctx.prepared`: a managed element with an O1 adaptor endpoint (or the `--element` given), and a PM
subscription for a counter new to the run. It never removes them. Ids are listed in `conformance/README.md`, and the README's trigger table is the contract a vendor's test
hook must meet. PM-1 reads RAN NF OAM's answer to the report because a report is not stored there (it goes to DME); the other checks read stored state.
