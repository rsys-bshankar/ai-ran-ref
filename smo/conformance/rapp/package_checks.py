"""The offline checks: a rApp package (a CSAR) against what Onboarding will do with it. Nothing is running; nothing is fetched.

PK-V is the verdict: it calls `onboarding/app/package_validation.py`, the code `POST /packages` runs, so a package that passes it onboards (the NFO call that
follows is the one thing it does not exercise). The others take the same parsers apart so a developer is told which file is wrong, and add advice Onboarding does
not give (a warning is not a refusal).
