"""SME (Service Management and Exposure): the single FastAPI module of the CAPIF-style core, served at `/sme` behind R1 Termination.

What it is: every route of the service (service publish and discovery, provider and invoker onboarding, OAuth2 token issue and introspection,
trusted-invoker security contexts, change-event subscriptions) plus the helpers behind them. It profiles 3GPP TS 29.222 (CAPIF) as R1AP clause 6
requires; the Foundational Platform LLD fixes two points the spec leaves open: section 2.2, one authorization gate for discovery and notification
(`_visible_to`), and section 2.3, the registration conflict rule (`serviceName` is globally unique; the same producer re-registering updates in place,
a different producer gets `SERVICE_NAME_CONFLICT`). Design record: `sme/README.md`; the history entries cited next to the code are in `HISTORY.md`.

Where it sits: R1 Termination calls `/oauth2/introspect` on every proxied request and every module's `R1Client` calls `/invoker-registrations` and
`/oauth2/token`. SME calls nothing itself except subscriber callbacks, and those go through the transactional outbox (`smo_shared.outbox`), never
a direct HTTP call from a route.

Owns: the tables in `models.py`, credential hashing, token lifetime and the scope check at issuance. Does not own: deciding whether a request needs a token
(R1 Termination), which routes an rApp may change (`smo_shared/roles.py`: `INTERNAL_ONLY` and `RAPP_MAY_CHANGE`; a new route is added there with its test),
or what an rApp's scope claim lets it touch (the module that owns the target, `smo_shared/scope.py`).

Before editing: (1) the docstring of a route function is published as its OpenAPI `description` (and so is the docstring of a request model), so changing
one makes `tests_integration/test_openapi_specs.py` fail until `scripts/generate_openapi_specs.py` is rerun; that is why the maintainer notes for routes are `#`
comments below the docstring. (2) Routes change the database and call `notify_*` before `db.commit()`: the outbox row is part of the same transaction
and is sent by a commit hook once it commits. (3) `import httpx` is kept although nothing here calls it: tests patch `app.main.httpx.post` (see `ruff.toml`).
