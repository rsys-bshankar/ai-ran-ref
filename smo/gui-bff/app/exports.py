"""Asynchronous CSV export jobs (GUI-9.5b): `POST /api/exports`, `GET /api/exports[/{id}[/file]]`, `DELETE /api/exports/{id}`.

The streamed exports (`GET /api/admin/audit.csv` here, RAN NF OAM's `GET /decision-records/export.csv`) hold one request open for the whole file,
and are bounded to 1,000,000 rows (and the decisions to 31 days) for that reason. A job instead runs as an asyncio task in the BFF instance that
accepted it, pages its source by keyset and appends the CSV to the database in chunks of at most `CHUNK_BYTES`; the browser asks how far it is
and downloads the file when it is DONE, from any instance on the same GUI_DATABASE_URL (the chunks are rows of `gui_export_chunk`, app/db.py).

- Sources: `decisions` (role operator) pages RAN NF OAM's `GET /decision-records?after=<cursor>` through the gateway, newest first, `DECISION_PAGE`
  rows a call, with the filters `since`, `until`, `invoker_id`, `disposition`, `region`, `site_cluster`; `audit` (role admin) reads the BFF's own
  `gui_audit_log` by id, newest first, with main.py's `audit_query` (`since`, `until`, `username`, `action`). No 31-day bound; at most `MAX_ROWS`
  rows (a job that reaches it ends DONE with `error` saying the file stops there); at most `MAX_ACTIVE_PER_USER` QUEUED or RUNNING jobs per user.
- The columns are those of the streamed exports, and a cell a spreadsheet would run as a formula gets a leading `'` (main.py's `_csv_cell`).
- Orphans: the task writes `heartbeat_at` at every page. A QUEUED or RUNNING job whose heartbeat is older than `STALE_SECONDS`, or that names this
  process as its runner but has no task here, lost its instance (a restart, a crash): it is marked FAILED "interrupted" when it is next read. A
  stopping instance marks its own jobs so at once (`ExportRunner.shutdown`, from main.py's lifespan).
- Lifetime: a job expires `TTL` after it finished (or was created, until then); an expired job is shown as EXPIRED, its file is a 410, and the next
  `POST /api/exports` (any user's) deletes every expired job with its chunks.
- Audited: `EXPORT_REQUESTED` (id, kind, filters), `EXPORT_DOWNLOADED`, `EXPORT_DELETED`.

Installed by main.py after the admin routes (it needs `audit_query`). The task is the one deliberate background work of this module, listed in
scripts/statelessness_allowlist.txt and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ("Process state and scale-out"): the job's state is in the database, the process only
does the work.
