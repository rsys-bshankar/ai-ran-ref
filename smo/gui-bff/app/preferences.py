"""The signed-in user's console preferences (the GUI redesign, BRIEF §4d): `GET` and `PUT /api/me/preferences`.

Installed by app/main.py next to the pins (app/rapps.py); stored by app/db.py's `UserPreference`, one JSON object per user. Every field is checked
against a closed set (an enum or a bounded number), so nothing the browser sends ends up in the page unvalidated: the SPA puts `theme`, `accent` and
`size` straight onto `<html>` as attributes. A field left out of a `PUT` keeps its default; an unknown field is refused (422), so a typo does not
silently vanish. Any signed-in user may read and change their own preferences, and only their own: there is no username in the path.
