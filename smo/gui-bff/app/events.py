"""The console's event stream (GUI-9.1): `GET /api/events?topics=summary:nav,summary:alarms`, Server-Sent Events.

A page that shows counts used to poll `GET /api/summary/{page}` every few seconds, once per open tab. Here one background poller per BFF process
recomputes each page that at least one stream subscribed to, every `POLL_SECONDS`, through app/summary.py's own cached computation
(`app.state.summary_page`, so a page asked by tiles and pushed to streams is still one fan-out per cache period), and sends a stream an
`event: summary` only when a count it holds has changed. Every `PING_SECONDS` a stream gets an `event: ping`, which keeps every proxy on the way
(nginx reads with a 60 s timeout by default) from closing an idle connection, and at that moment the session is checked again, so a revoked
session or a deactivated user loses the stream within one ping.

Installed by app/main.py. Reads only. What a maintainer must know:

- A topic is `summary:<page>` with a page of `summary.PAGES`, optionally narrowed to a scope (GUI-9.3): `summary:<page>@<region>` or
  `summary:<page>@<region>/<site_cluster>`, each name checked against `summary.SCOPE_RE`; or `summary:attention` (GUI-9.8b, the Dashboard's
  "Needs your attention" groups, also with an optional `@<region>[/<site_cluster>]`), sent as `event: attention`. Nothing else is a topic yet
  (alarms, approvals and decisions as raw events would need the modules to publish them; the counts are what the console patches today).
  Within the hub a topic is keyed by what follows `summary:` (`nav`, `nav@north/c1`, `attention`). At most `MAX_TOPICS` per stream, at most
  `MAX_STREAMS_PER_USER` open streams per user in this process (several BFF instances each count their own).
- A stream ends by itself after `STREAM_MAX_SECONDS`; the browser's EventSource reconnects after `RETRY_MS`, which also re-reads the session.
  The tests shorten the three timings to read a whole stream with the buffering TestClient.
- What each stream has been sent is kept per stream (`_Subscriber.seen`), so "changed" is relative to what that browser holds, and a stream that
  opens later than another gets the full counts first, then only changes.
- The response carries `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, and smo/gui/nginx.conf has its own location for `/api/events` with buffering off: a buffering
  proxy would hold every event until its buffer fills.
