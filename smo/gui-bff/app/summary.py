"""Summary counts for the console's tiles, badges and meters (the GUI redesign, SCALE.md P2): `GET /api/summary/{page}`.

Before this, every tile counted rows of the first page of a list in the browser, so past 100 rows (the SMO's default page size,
smo_shared/pagination.py) every count was wrong. Here the BFF asks each module for a one-row page with the filter that defines the count
(`?severity=critical&limit=1`) and reads the envelope's `total`, which the module computes with `COUNT(*)` in SQL. The calls of one page run in
parallel, and the answer is kept `CACHE_SECONDS` and shared by every signed-in user: the counts are module-wide reads that every role may make
(app/rbac.py lets a viewer read every module), so no user's view differs from another's.

Installed by app/main.py. Reads only: nothing here writes. A count whose module did not answer is `null` and named in `partial`, so a tile shows
"—" and the box says which module is missing (SCALE.md P10) instead of the whole summary failing. Which counts a page gets is the `PAGES` table
below; the GUI's `src/data/summary.ts` reads the same keys. A few values are not a `total` but one field of a module's statistics answer (the mean
time to acknowledge, `alarms.mtta`, from RAN NF OAM's `/alarms/stats`; the number of stopped rApps from rApp Management's `GET /kill-all`): a
`Count` with `field` set. Such a field may be null in a good answer (no alarm acknowledged in the window), which is not a missing module.
A count that needs data no module serves today (a network health score) is deliberately not here: the GUI shows "—" for it (BRIEF §5).

The same cached computation feeds the event stream (app/events.py): `install` keeps it on `app.state.summary_page`, so a page pushed to fifty
open streams and asked by fifty tiles is still one fan-out per `CACHE_SECONDS`.

GUI-9.3, the scope picker: `?region=` and `?site_cluster=` narrow every count whose module list accepts them (`SCOPED_PATHS`, the paths and which of
the two parameters each takes); the other counts stay network-wide and are named in the answer's `unscoped`. The cache key is the page and the scope,
so each scope is its own shared entry (at most `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES` entries, the oldest dropped first). A scope value is checked against `SCOPE_RE`
before it reaches a module or a cache key.

GUI-9.8b, "Needs your attention": `GET /api/summary/attention` is the Dashboard's four short lists in one call (`ATTENTION`): each group is one
call to its module for the newest `limit` rows with the filter of the matching count, which answers the rows and their `total` together. The rows are
trimmed to the fields the GUI shows. Cached and shared the same way (`app.state.summary_attention`, also fed to the event stream as the topic
`summary:attention`). This route is declared before `/api/summary/{page}`, so "attention" is never read as a page name.

GUI-9.11, the Dashboard in three calls: a page can also carry `panels` (`PANELS`), small module answers kept whole (the latest decisions, the fleet
health by region, the worst elements, the 24 hourly alarm buckets), asked in the same parallel fan-out as its counts, narrowed by the same scope and
cached and pushed with them. The Dashboard's first load is then this summary, the attention call and the shell's module status.
