"""PR-SEC-10: what a caller with a scope claim may touch, decided here because this module owns the targets (docs/adr/0005-tenant-region-authorization.md).

The claim comes from the gateway (`smo_shared.scope.request_scope`); the target's `region` and `tenant` are columns of `managed_entity`. Everything here is the one rule of
`smo_shared.scope.permits`, applied to the registry:

  - an **unscoped** caller (no claim) is never asked anything: no query is made, the answer is "yes", exactly as before this existed;
  - a managed element that is **not registered** has no region and no tenant, so a scoped caller may not touch it. A request that names an element by its reference
    (a config job, a read of its configuration) therefore gets the same 403 `SCOPE_DENIED` for an element that does not exist as for one that is out of scope: the
    answer does not tell a scoped caller which references exist;
  - an item addressed by an id the system made (an alarm, a job, a file) that is out of scope is a 404, as if it did not exist; a list leaves it out;
  - a managed object addressed by its DN (`/managed-objects/{dn}`) is the same: the tree a scoped caller sees is the tree of its own elements, so an object of another
    element is a 404 exactly as one that is not there (a 403 beside a 404 would tell it which DNs exist);
  - what has no element of its own (the vendor and CM-schema registries) is shown for what the caller's elements use (`visible_vendor_names`);
  - ownership of a job (PR-SEC-10.11) is a second, separate rule: whom a job belongs to (`owned_jobs`, `job_owned_by`), applied only to a caller with a claim.

PR-GUI-9.3 adds the **place filters** at the bottom of this file: the optional `region` and `site_cluster` query parameters every list tied to managed
elements accepts, matched against `managed_entity.region` / `.site_cluster`. They narrow; they never authorize: the caller's scope claim above still
applies (or, on a list that is internal-only and not scoped, is not asked), and a filter can only take rows away. A row tied to several elements (a
config job, an approval, a decision record) matches when ANY of its elements is in the place. The SQL is portable except for the expansion of a JSON
list of references (`json_each` on SQLite, `json_array_elements_text` on Postgres), which branches on the dialect like `alarm_query.py` does.
