"""The periodic work of RAN NF OAM (PR-MSG-4), run by `python -m smo_shared.worker` (compose service `ran-nf-oam-worker`), never by a request
process. Each task finds what is due from the database, does it in committed steps, and may run again after a crash.

  advance-waves             every 15 s   the next wave of every staged CM job whose pause has elapsed (`POST /config-jobs/advance-due`), and of every software campaign
                                         (`POST /software-campaigns/advance-due`, which also fails the software jobs of a campaign with a `jobTimeoutSeconds` that have not reported in time, MGT-15.7)
  publish-kpis              every 30 s   the KPI schedules whose interval has passed (`PUT /kpi-schedules/{id}`)
  run-kpi-guards            every minute the KPI guards of finished CM jobs whose observation window has passed (`kpiGuard` on `POST /config-jobs`)
  expire-approvals          every minute the rApp action approvals nobody decided in time (EXPIRED or REJECTED by the policy they were parked under; AI-11.3)
  chain-decisions           every minute the decision records not yet written to the audit chain (AI-13.1; normally done right after the commit)
  purge-safeguard-refusals  every hour   refusal records older than `SAFEGUARD_REFUSAL_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 0: keep them)
  purge-cleared-alarms      every hour   alarms cleared more than `SMO_RETENTION_ALARMS_DAYS` ago (default 0: keep); an alarm still raised is never purged
  purge-pm-files            every hour   PM files ready more than `SMO_RETENTION_PM_FILES_DAYS` ago (default 0: keep); the content is the row, no file on disk
  purge-approvals           every hour   rApp action approvals decided more than `SMO_RETENTION_APPROVALS_DAYS` ago (default 0: keep); a request still waiting is never purged
  purge-decision-records    every hour   decision records made more than `SMO_RETENTION_DECISION_RECORDS_DAYS` ago (default 0: keep) and already written to the audit chain;
                                         the chain's rows (`audit_log`) are never touched, so `python -m smo_shared.audit verify` still passes

A purge task whose retention is `0` still estimates its table's rows (`smo_shared.retention.report_retention_off`): the gauge `smo_retention_off_rows{table}`
and one WARNING a day above `SMO_RETENTION_WARN_ROWS`.
