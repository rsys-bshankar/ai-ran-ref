"""Intent Service: the FastAPI module for TS 28.312 intents, their reports, intent handling functions (RMIHs), utility formulas and rApp autonomy
dispatches, served at `/intent-service` behind R1 Termination.

What it is: every route of the service and the helpers behind them. An intent owner (an rApp or the GUI, the RMIO) addresses an intent to one RMIH it
chose by `rmihId`; this module validates it, checks it against what that RMIH declares it can handle, stores it with an initial report, queues a push to
the RMIH, and delivers every later report to the recipients named in the intent's report control. An autonomy dispatch (`HISTORY.md` OI-6.3) is the
record that turns an AI/ML inference outcome into an intent according to the rApp instance's autonomy mode. Enactment belongs to the RMIH, not here.
Design record: `intent-service/README.md`; SMO Design v1.3 section 3.12 and Policy Mgmt LLD sections 1-3 (this module was Policy Management & Info SMOS
before it was renamed; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, Intent Service).

Where it sits: rApps (through `sdk.intent`), the GUI BFF and SA SMOS call the routes through R1 Termination. The only outbound read is
`GET /rapp-mgmt/instances/{id}` (through `R1Client`, autonomy dispatch only). Pushes and reports to an RMIH, a report recipient or an operator are outbox rows
(`smo_shared.outbox`), never a direct HTTP call from a route. The spec models live in `ts28312.py`; this file does not redefine them.

Owns: the capability, feasibility and conflict rules that decide whether an intent is accepted, the initial report, report delivery, the admin-state
rule (only the creating RMIO may change it), the RMIH registration rule (an rApp identity may not register) and the autonomy-dispatch state machine
(`AWAITING_SCOPE`, `DISPATCHED`, `SHADOWED`, `REJECTED`). Does not own: which caller may call which route (R1 Termination checks the token; the GUI BFF pins
`rmioId` and restricts registration and report publication) or the autonomy mode and region scope of an instance (rApp Management).

Before editing: (1) the docstring of a route function or a request model is published as OpenAPI text, so changing one makes
`tests_integration/test_openapi_specs.py` fail until `scripts/generate_openapi_specs.py` is rerun; the maintainer notes for routes are `#` comments under
the docstring. (2) `_create_intent_row` does not commit; its callers do, so the intent, its first report and the notifications are one transaction (PR-MSG-1.9).
A route that creates or changes something enqueues its notifications before `db.commit()` and never after. (3) `import httpx` is kept although nothing here
calls it: the tests patch `app.main.httpx.post` (see `ruff.toml`).
