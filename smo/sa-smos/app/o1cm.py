"""Generic O1-CM intent handler — Wave 8 (HISTORY.md W8-07,
decision D-1).

SA SMOS registers itself with Intent Service as an IntentHandlingFunction
(RMIH `sa-smos`) for RAN_SUBNETWORK expectations whose targets are O1 CM
attributes, named `<IOC>.<attribute>` (TS 28.541 class and attribute), e.g.
`NRCellDU.administrativeState` or `CESManagementFunction.energySavingControl`.
Those are generic TS 28.312 ExpectationTargets (the families allow any
target name beside their specialised ones), so any rApp can express
"set this CM attribute on these cells" as an Intent, and an AUTONOMOUS or
operator-resolved ASSIST AutonomyDispatch becomes a real O1 change.

When Intent Service pushes a new Intent here, the handler:

  1. reads the Intent back (Intent Service is the source of truth);
  2. for each expectation, takes `expectationObject.objectInstance` as the
     managed element and its `Cell` object context (if any) as the cells,
     and turns every `IS_EQUAL_TO` CM target into an attribute change per
     cell (`managedFunctionRef` = `<IOC>=<cell>`);
  3. writes them through DME's O1 action mediation (`POST /dme/actions`,
     which forwards to RAN NF OAM's config jobs — the same audited path a
     manual CM write takes), one action per expectation, carrying the
     intent/expectation ids as its source context;
  4. publishes the Intent's IntentReport: FULFILLED when every change was
     applied, otherwise NOT_FULFILLED / DEGRADED, with the DME action and
     RAN NF OAM job references in `additionalFulfilmentInfo` (W6-04).

Each enactment is recorded (`GET /o1-cm-handler/enactments`).
