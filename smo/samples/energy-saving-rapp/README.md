# EnergySaving rApp

A Non-RT RIC rApp that predicts sustained low PRB utilisation from O1 PM data, puts lightly used cells to sleep through O1, verifies every write, and wakes the cells before load returns. R1 only: no A1, Near-RT RIC, xApp or E2.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Use case | Energy Saving (cell sleep / wake) |
| Model | `EnergySavingPredictor`: threshold rule over a linear regression of next-hour PRB (`REGRESSION`), plain-Python, stored in MLMR as `energy_model.zip` |
| O1 targets | `NRCellDU` and `CESManagementFunction` |
| O1 actuators (per instance) | `NRCellDU.administrativeState` (`LOCKED` / `UNLOCKED`, default) or `CESManagementFunction.energySavingControl` (`TO_BE_ENERGY_SAVING` / `TO_BE_NOT_ENERGY_SAVING`) |
| Datasets | `PRB_UTILIZATION` (training, validation, inference); `PRB_UTILIZATION_SIM` (emulation, Digital Twin) |
| Autonomy modes | SHADOW, ASSIST, AUTONOMOUS |
| Operator API | served on `:8000` as `/instances/...`; the instance's base URL is registered at rApp Management (`operatorApiBase` when the instance is created) and R1 Termination reaches it at `/rapps/<instance>/operator/...`. The page the GUI draws for it is declared in `manifest.yaml` (`operatorUi`) |

## What it does

One pass of the closed loop is `POST /instances/{id}/evaluate`; its `X-Correlation-ID` is the execution id in the audit trail.

- Data in: the per-cell `PRB_UTILIZATION` series from DME, cell guard attributes and critical alarms from RAN NF OAM, and MDAF's PRB prediction when there is one.
- Model: an AIMgF inference job on the ACTIVE MLIF runtime; the model returns `futurePrb`, `recommendedState` and `confidence` for each cell.
- Decision: `app/engine.py` returns LOCK, UNLOCK or NO_CHANGE per cell after the safety evaluation.
- Idempotency: a cell whose live O1 value already equals the wanted one gets no action (`NO_ACTION_ALREADY_IN_STATE`).
- Autonomy dispatch (LOCK only): the LOCK expectation goes to `sdk.intent` as an AutonomyDispatch. SHADOW records it as `SHADOWED`; ASSIST waits in `AWAITING_SCOPE` until an operator resolves or rejects it; AUTONOMOUS runs Intent, SA SMOS O1-CM handler, DME, RAN NF OAM, NETCONF.
- O1 write (UNLOCK, rollback, override): these restore service, so they go straight to DME `/actions` in every enforcing mode, each with its own `actionId`. In SHADOW an UNLOCK is only recorded.
- Verify: every write is read back with `sdk.data.read_config`.
- Revert: a failed, partial or unverified LOCK is rolled back to UNLOCKED through the same DME path, re-sent once if the read-back still disagrees. Every pass writes one `energy_saving_decision` row per cell (prediction, safety, intent, action, verification, rollback, final state).

## Design

Decision logic (`app/engine.py`, pure functions). Cell states are internal: SERVING, PRE_SLEEP, SLEEP. Only PRE_SLEEP to SLEEP (LOCK) and SLEEP to SERVING (UNLOCK) write to O1.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Sleep threshold | PRB below 5 % |
| Sustain window | 60 minutes, measured on the samples' own timestamps |
| Wake threshold | predicted PRB above 15 % (model or MDAF) |
| Neighbour congestion | a neighbour above 80 % PRB |
| Recently unlocked | less than 30 minutes ago |
| Hysteresis | 5 to 15 % is NO_CHANGE in both directions |

- LOCK needs all of: PRB below 5 % for 60 minutes; the model recommends `LOCKED`; MDAF (if present) is also below 5 %; no model or MDAF prediction above 15 %; all guards pass. Less than 60 minutes gives PRE_SLEEP (`SUSTAINING_LOW_LOAD`).
- UNLOCK of a sleeping cell on any one of: operator override, coverage alarm, neighbour congestion, predicted load above 15 %.
- Guards block a LOCK whatever the model's confidence. HARD: `EMERGENCY_CELL`, `COVERAGE_CRITICAL_CELL`, `LAST_SECTOR`, `INCIDENT_ZONE`. MEDIUM: `NEIGHBOUR_CONGESTION`, `ACTIVE_CRITICAL_ALARM`. SOFT: `RECENTLY_UNLOCKED`.
- Cells earlier in a pass that decide LOCK count as asleep for the sector-group check of later cells.
- Operator override unlocks the cell now and suppresses AI recommendations for it until cleared.
- Model: next-hour PRB = now + drift + trend gain x (now - one hour ago) + seasonal gain x (hourly profile change), fitted by least squares. Validation passes at score 0.8 or more and RMSE 5.0 or less. Emulation replays the Digital Twin trend, requires midnight hours below 5 % to come out `LOCKED`, and allows at most 5 % of sleep recommendations to meet load above 15 %.
- Coordination with peers: `app/main.py` does not read other rApps' state. The guards that protect neighbours are RAN NF OAM cell guards, neighbour PRB and alarms. [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) describes peer reads for the reference rApps in general; this rApp has none.

## Package

Layout and field semantics: [RAPP_PACKAGING.md](../../docs/RAPP_PACKAGING.md).

- Manifest: `EnergySaving_rApp` 1.0.0, vendor Radisys, deployment model NonRT-RIC; execution modes TRAINING, VALIDATION, EMULATION, INFERENCE; autonomy modes SHADOW, ASSIST, AUTONOMOUS; required services DME, AIMgF, MLMR, MLLF, RAN-NF-OAM; runtime profiles (cpu / memory / gpu) of 8 / 16Gi / 0 for TRAINING, 4 / 8Gi / 0 for VALIDATION and EMULATION, 2 / 4Gi / 0 for INFERENCE.
- Capabilities: consumes `data`, `analytics`, `models`, `lifecycle`, `intent`, `platform`; provides `data` (`PRB_UTILIZATION_SIM`). Produced model `EnergySavingPredictor`; supported actions `LOCK_CELL`, `UNLOCK_CELL`; vendor modes `O1_NETCONF`, `O1_RESTCONF`; supported analytics `TRAFFIC_FORECAST`.
- Deliberately absent: no deployment item (Helm chart) in the ASD, because the service runs as a compose service reached through R1 Termination; no `Files/Sme`, `Files/Dme` or `Files/Acm`, because the rApp registers its DME type from code (`app/producer.py`).
- `build_csar.py` leaves out `tests/` and this README. Rebuild only after editing the package files.
- The committed `energy-saving-rapp.csar` is **signed** with the demo publisher's key (`TOSCA-Metadata/DIGESTS.sha256` and `.sig`, `../README.md`): a rebuild with the demo key is byte-identical. The key is public on purpose; never trust it in production.

## Service API

Served on port 8000. R1 Termination reaches it at `/rapps/<instance>/operator/...` once the instance has registered its base URL (`operatorApiBase` in `POST /rapp-mgmt/instances`; `demo.py` and the integration environments pass it). The GUI draws its page from the `operatorUi` at the end of `manifest.yaml` (the worked example of `docs/adr/0004-operator-ui-declaration.md`): the instance block, Evaluate now and Reconcile approvals, and the cells table with a per-cell Override and a drawer (PRB chart, the latest execution, the last 20 decisions). Only those routes are reachable from the GUI; `start`, `lifecycle/*` and `sim-producer/*` are API calls.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness |
| `POST /instances/{id}/start` | Bind to the rapp-mgmt instance; discover one data job per mode |
| `GET /instances`, `GET /instances/{id}` | List or read instances |
| `POST /instances/{id}/lifecycle/train` | Register the model in MLMR, train, store the artifact |
| `POST /instances/{id}/lifecycle/validate` | Validation job (held-out score) |
| `POST /instances/{id}/lifecycle/emulate` | Emulation job on the Digital Twin dataset |
| `POST /instances/{id}/lifecycle/deploy` | Deploy and activate the MLIF runtime (needs a certified model) |
| `POST /instances/{id}/evaluate` | One closed-loop pass |
| `POST /instances/{id}/reconcile` | Follow up ASSIST dispatches an operator resolved or rejected |
| `POST` / `DELETE /instances/{id}/cells/{cell_id}/override` | Operator unlock; clear the override |
| `GET /instances/{id}/decisions` | Audit trail; filters `cell_id`, `execution_id`, `limit` |
| `GET /instances/{id}/cells` | Cell states |
| `GET /instances/{id}/dashboard` | Per cell PRB trend, latest decision, state; `points` (default 48) |
| `POST /sim-producer/register`, `POST /sim-producer/publish` | Register and feed the Digital Twin type |

`app/producer.py` also mounts the DME callback routes for that type.

## Run and test

Unit tests (51 passed):

```bash
cd smo/samples/energy-saving-rapp && PYTHONPATH=.:../../shared:../../sdk python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Demo, inside the compose network (for example from the `r1-termination` container); see [DEMO_RUNBOOK.md](../../DEMO_RUNBOOK.md) section 24 for the CSAR serving steps:

```bash
python3 demo.py 00        # one step (00-11)
python3 demo.py all       # every step in order
```

Ids are kept between steps in `$DEMO_STATE` (default `/tmp/energy-saving-demo.json`). `DEMO_ME` and `DEMO_CSAR_URL` override the managed element (default `gnb-du-demo-01`) and CSAR URL. Timestamps are simulation time (history 2026-09-01..03, live PM from midnight on the 4th). End-to-end coverage is in `tests_integration/test_energy_saving_rapp.py`.

## Limits

- A critical alarm blocks a cell's LOCK when it is raised on the cell, on a neighbour the cell hands its traffic to (`neighbourRefs`), or on the managed element as a whole (an alarm that names no cell). A coverage alarm wakes a cell on the same terms.
- The shipped model is threshold plus regression; an LSTM variant is backlog (HISTORY.md, W10.1 `W10-B1`).
- State tables live in the shared Postgres (`migrations/001_init.sql`), not a private rApp store.
- Training fails with 422 on fewer than 3 hourly history rows.
- `capabilities.yaml` lists `TRAFFIC_FORECAST` as supported analytics, but the code consumes MDAF PRB predictions only.
- See [OPEN_ITEMS.md](../../OPEN_ITEMS.md) and [STANDARDS.md](../../docs/STANDARDS.md) (Wave 10.1).
