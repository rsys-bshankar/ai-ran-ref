"""Sample coverage data for the Coverage Optimization rApp (Wave 10.3,
W10.3-03).

  * `propagation` is a small, deterministic stand-in for the radio
    network. It turns a cluster's tilt and power settings, plus an
    injected fault, into each cell's problem shares and neighbour overlaps.
    The integration tests and demo.py feed it the **live** O1 settings read
    back from the mock adaptor. So every tilt or power change the rApp makes
    shows up in the next hour's PM, and the loop really closes.
  * `cell_counters` / `measurements` shape that as the PM reports an NF
    sends RAN NF OAM (`POST /ran-nf-oam/pm-reports`, counter type
    COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE). RAN NF OAM delivers them to DME.
  * `history` is training history in which tilt and power were varied, a
    cell at a time, so the sensitivities can be learned.
  * The Digital Twin producer registers `COVERAGE_PERFORMANCE_SIM`
    (sourceDomain DIGITAL_TWIN) and publishes clusters with a known
    injected fault, so emulation can score the optimiser's moves.

The propagation model is linear in each cell's reach. Reach is the uptilt t
in degrees below the baseline tilt, plus the power step p in dB over the
baseline power:

    weak_i      = W_i − 0.8 t_i − 1.5 p_i − Σ_j c_ij (0.3 t_j + 0.3 p_j)
    overshoot_i = O_i + 1.8 t_i + 0.6 p_i
    pollution_i = P_i + 0.2 (t_i + p_i) + Σ_j c_ij (1.2 t_j + 0.6 p_j)
    overlap_ij  = L_ij + 2.0 t_j + 1.0 p_j − 0.5 (t_i + p_i)

Here c_ij = L_ij / 10. Injected faults change the bases:
  * WEAK_COVERAGE at a cell raises its W;
  * OVERSHOOT at a cell raises its O. It also raises its neighbours' P and
    their overlap with it, because it reaches into them;
  * PILOT_POLLUTION at a cell raises its P and its overlap with every
    neighbour.
