"""CoverageSensitivityModel — the Coverage Optimization rApp's model and its
joint neighbour optimiser (Wave 10.3, W10.3-02, decision D10.3-2).

Each cell has three problem shares, in % of its measurement reports:
WEAK_COVERAGE, OVERSHOOT and PILOT_POLLUTION. A cell's "reach" grows when
it is uptilted or its power is raised. The model is linear in the reach
steps:

    Δshare[k]_i = own_t[k]·t_i + own_p[k]·p_i
                  + Σ_j c_ij · (nbr_t[k]·t_j + nbr_p[k]·p_j)

  * t is the uptilt in degrees (−Δtilt), and p the power step in dB.
  * c_ij is neighbour j's overlap with cell i, in tens of percent.

The 12 sensitivities (3 shares × 4 terms) are learned by least squares from
history in which tilt and power varied.

The optimiser searches the cluster jointly. Each cell can make one move:
NONE, DOWNTILT, UPTILT (1°), POWER_UP or POWER_DOWN (1 dB). At most
MAX_CELLS_PER_PASS cells move. Each candidate move set is scored by:

    objective = Σ_cells Σ_k max(0, share − 5 %)  +  CELL_COST · cells moved

The best move set is taken if it beats doing nothing by at least MIN_GAIN,
and no cell's own excess is predicted to grow by more than
WORSEN_TOLERANCE. Because neighbours' terms are in the model, pollution in
one cell can be cured by downtilting the neighbour that overshoots into it.

The artifact is plain JSON in a .zip (`coverage_model.json`) stored in
MLMR. Like the other reference models, it is pure Python.
