# Mobility Optimization rApp

A Non-RT RIC rApp that classifies handover failures per neighbour relation and tunes each relation's Cell Individual Offset (CIO) through O1, within DMRO bounds it imposes on the gNB.

## At a glance

| | |

| Use case | Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) |
| Model | `MobilityRobustnessPredictor` (CLASSIFICATION_REGRESSION): failure classification plus a linear next-hour failure-rate regression |
| O1 targets | `NRCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset` (actuator); `DMROFunction` (`maximumDeviationHoTriggerLow`, `maximumDeviationHoTriggerHigh`, `minimumTimeBetweenHoTriggerChange`, `dmroControl`) |
| Datasets | `HO_PERFORMANCE` (training, validation, inference); `HO_PERFORMANCE_SIM` (Digital Twin, emulation) |
| Autonomy modes | SHADOW, ASSIST, AUTONOMOUS |

## What it does

One `POST /instances/{id}/evaluate` is one pass of the loop over the instance's relations:

- **Data in.** Hourly per-relation `MM.*` counters (attempts, too-late, too-early, wrong-cell, ping-pong) are read from DME as `HO_PERFORMANCE`.
- **Model.** The model computes the mobility problem rate (failures plus ping-pongs, per attempt, in %), names the dominant failure class, and predicts next-hour rate. An inference job is recorded in AIMgF.
- **Decision.** The engine checks the last change's KPI, then the guards, then the prediction, then takes one bounded CIO step.
- **Autonomy dispatch.** CIO changes (RAISE or LOWER) go to `AutonomyDispatch`. SHADOW only records a recommendation. ASSIST waits for the operator, and `reconcile` settles it afterwards. AUTONOMOUS goes through an Intent, the SA SMOS O1-CM handler, DME and RAN NF OAM.
- **O1 write.** `NRCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset` is written (six identical entries per TS 28.541). At deploy, the DMRO bounds are written to `DMROFunction`.
- **Verify.** Every write is read back over O1. A failed or unverified write is rolled back to the previous CIO.
- **Revert.** A changed relation is OBSERVING until 60 minutes of post-change PM exist. If its rate is then worse, the previous CIO is restored straight through DME `/actions`.
- **Audit.** One decision row per relation per pass, keyed by the request's correlation id.

## Design

Decision logic is in `app/engine.py` (pure functions) and `app/model/MobilityModel.py`.

- **Rate and bands.** Predicted rate of 5 % or more acts, 2 % to 5 % is a hold zone, below 2 % is healthy. The prediction is `rateNow + w0 + w1 * (rateNow - rateHourAgo)`; untrained weights give plain persistence.
- **Step.** The dominant class sets the direction: TOO_LATE +2 dB, TOO_EARLY and PING_PONG -2 dB, WRONG_CELL -1 dB. The result is clamped to baseline +/- 6 dB; a step that would not move the CIO is `AT_BOUND`.
- **KPI revert.** Degraded means post-change rate above pre-change rate by more than 0.5 points.
- **Guards** (any one blocks a change, whatever the confidence):
  - `HO_NOT_ALLOWED`: relation has `isHOAllowed=false`.
  - `PROTECTED_CELL`: source or target is EMERGENCY or in an incident zone (from `sdk.data.query_cell_guards`).
  - `TARGET_ASLEEP`: target is O1 LOCKED or energy saving, or EnergySaving reports SLEEP or PRE_SLEEP.
  - `TARGET_RECENTLY_WOKEN`: target woke less than 30 minutes ago.
  - `INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLES`: fewer than 50 handover attempts in the window.
  - `PACING`: relation changed less than 60 minutes ago.
  - `MLB_OBSERVING`: the Traffic Steering rApp has a CIO change on the relation under observation (shared CIO).
- **DMRO bounds.** Written at deploy and read back (`VERIFIED` or `VERIFY_FAILED`). Defaults: `dmroControl` true, deviation -6 / +6, `minimumTimeBetweenHoTriggerChange` 60. The instance config key `dmroBounds` overrides them.
- **Validation.** Held-out ACT / HOLD / HEALTHY band score of at least 0.8 and RMSE of at most 1.5 points.
- **Emulation.** Correct CIO direction on at least 90 % of faulty windows and no action on a healthy relation.
- **Peers.** Optional `energySavingInstanceId` and `trafficSteeringInstanceId` in the instance config make it read those rApps' published cell and relation states over R1. Without them, the corresponding guards stay open.

## Package

Package layout and field meanings are in [RAPP_PACKAGING.md](../../docs/RAPP_PACKAGING.md); the rApp's place in the platform is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#reference-rapps).

- `manifest.yaml`: all four execution modes, three autonomy modes, required services DME, AIMgF, MLMR, MLLF and RAN-NF-OAM, and a runtime profile per mode.
- `capabilities.yaml` consumes `data`, `models`, `lifecycle`, `intent` and `platform`, and provides the `HO_PERFORMANCE_SIM` dataset under `data`. It also lists supported actions `RAISE_CIO`, `LOWER_CIO` and `REVERT_CIO`.
- No `analytics` namespace. The rApp derives its features from the DME datasets and calls no MDAF prediction or report.
- Nothing else is provided: there is no SDK surface for an rApp to serve to others.
- `README.md` is not part of the CSAR (`../build_csar.py` excludes it).

## Service API

Paths are relative to the service root; through R1 Termination they sit under `/mobility-optimization-rapp`.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness |
| `POST /instances/{id}/start` | Bind to the rapp-mgmt instance, discover datasets |
| `GET /instances`, `GET /instances/{id}` | Instance state |
| `POST /instances/{id}/lifecycle/{train,validate,emulate,deploy}` | Model lifecycle; deploy also writes DMRO bounds |
| `POST /instances/{id}/evaluate` | One closed-loop pass |
| `POST /instances/{id}/reconcile` | Settle ASSIST dispatches the operator has resolved |
| `GET /instances/{id}/decisions` | Audit trail (`relation`, `execution_id` filters) |
| `GET /instances/{id}/relations` | Per-relation state and CIO (read by the Coverage rApp) |
| `GET /instances/{id}/dashboard` | Trends, latest decision per relation |
| `POST /sim-producer/register`, `POST /sim-producer/publish` | Register and feed the Digital Twin dataset |
| `GET /sim-producer/health`, `POST /sim-producer/jobs`, `DELETE /sim-producer/jobs/{id}` | DME producer callbacks |

`/start` needs `managedElementRef` and `relations` (`[{relation, source, target}]`) in the instance configuration; optional keys are `baselineCio`, `dmroBounds`, `rmihId`, `energySavingInstanceId`, `trafficSteeringInstanceId` and `operatorNotificationUri`.

## Run and test

```bash
cd smo/samples/mobility-optimization-rapp
PYTHONPATH=.:../../shared:../../sdk python -m pytest tests/ -q     # 46 passed
```

The demo runs against a live stack, from inside the compose network (for example the `r1-termination` container). Steps are Demo 00 to 11:

```bash
python3 demo.py 00        # one step
python3 demo.py all       # every step in order
```

Ids persist between steps in `$DEMO_STATE` (default `/tmp/mobility-optimization-demo.json`); the gNB name can be set with `DEMO_ME`. Timestamps are simulation time (history 2026-09-01..03, live PM from midnight on the 4th). The full procedure, including copying the CSAR and the script into the container, is in [DEMO_RUNBOOK.md section 25](../../DEMO_RUNBOOK.md).

## Limits

- Only `NRCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset` is tuned, with the same value in all six entries. A live CIO whose entries differ is treated as unknown and the stored value is used.
- Thresholds (5 %, 2 %, 50 attempts, 60 and 30 minutes, 6 dB) are fixed in code, not configurable per relation.
- The model is a persistence-anchored linear regression with a rule-based classifier; it has no learned failure classification.
- Coordination with EnergySaving and Traffic Steering is by polling their R1 routes; an unreachable peer is treated as "no information", not as a block.
- `supportedVendorModes` lists `O1_NETCONF` and `O1_RESTCONF`; RAN NF OAM dispatches over whichever the managed element is provisioned for.
- Open items for the platform are in [OPEN_ITEMS.md](../../OPEN_ITEMS.md); none is specific to this rApp.
