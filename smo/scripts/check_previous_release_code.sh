# The rule (CLAUDE.md, "Schema changes"): a schema revision is additive, so the release before it keeps working on the upgraded database while
# a rolling upgrade is half done. This proves it: build the previous release (newest `smo-v*` tag, or the one given) from its own source,
# start its compose stack on a database migrated to THIS commit's head by THIS commit's scripts/migrate.py (the previous release's own
# `migrate` service is replaced by a no-op: it does not know the newer revisions), and replay the previous release's own demo runbook
# against it. Then, as a control, break the schema on purpose and check the same replay fails: a check that cannot fail proves nothing.
#
# Needs docker and, on the host, the runtime dependencies (for migrate.py). Leaves nothing behind (the stack and the worktree are removed).
