"""PR-SEC-2.2 / 2.3: the mutual-TLS stack (docker-compose.mtls.yml) refuses what it should and answers what it should.

Runs INSIDE the r1-termination container (it has a certificate, the CA, and every module resolves from there), fed on stdin by the CI job:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mtls.yml exec -T r1-termination python3 - < scripts/compose_mtls_check.py

Checks, for every service that serves mTLS:
  * a client with the right certificate gets /live over https (200);
  * a client that verifies the server but presents NO certificate is refused;
  * a client whose certificate comes from ANOTHER CA (a throwaway one made here) is refused;
  * plain http on the same port gets no answer from the application;
and, through the gateway: /bootstrap names https addresses, and an unauthenticated routed call is 401 (the token gate is still there; the certificate is
in addition to it, never instead of it). The services that are not mTLS servers (mock-o1-adaptor, gui-bff) still answer plain HTTP.
The runbook replay (tests_integration/test_demo_runbook.py with SMO_MTLS=on) is the proof that the calls between modules work; this is the proof of the refusals.
