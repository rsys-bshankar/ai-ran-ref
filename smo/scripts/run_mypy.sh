# Type check (PR-V-2b..2j) of every module: `scripts/run_mypy.sh [module...]` from smo/ (the `lint` job runs it with no argument).
# The same settings everywhere (check_untyped_defs: the bodies of functions without annotations are checked too, which is where the findings are;
# a package without type information is Any). A new module is added to MODULES in the PR that adds it. A sample rApp is `samples/<name>` (its `app` package, with the
# SDK and the shared library on the path, as its tests have them). Not covered: tests_integration (103 findings in 23 files at the last count, mostly the
# importlib `spec.loader` idiom and untyped test doubles; the sample rApps' and modules' tests are not checked either, only their `app`).
