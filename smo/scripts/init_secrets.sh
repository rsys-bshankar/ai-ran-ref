#
#   scripts/init_secrets.sh
#
# smo/secrets/enrollment_secret  what every SMO module presents to SME when it registers, so SME can tell it from an rApp (PR-SEC-14);
#                           mounted by every module except the sample rApps, never given to an rApp
# smo/secrets/db_password   the Postgres password: a random 48-hex-character value, never printed. An existing
#                           file is left alone, so running this again does not lock the stack out of its own
#                           database. To rotate it, see docs/SECRETS.md.
#
# smo/secrets/db_password_onboarding
#                           the password of the database role smo_onboarding (PR-DB-2.6), which Onboarding connects as: it can use its own schema and
#                           nothing else. scripts/db_roles.py (run by the `migrate` service) sets it in the database; a file that is missing means
#                           no role is made. One file per module that has a role (`migrations/db_roles.json`), as modules adopt them.
#
# The directory is owner-only (0700) and git-ignored. The file itself is 0644: Compose bind-mounts it as it is,
# and the services run as uid 10001, not as you, so it has to be readable by other users; the directory is what
# keeps other accounts on this machine out. Postgres and every module read it at /run/secrets/db_password
# (POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE, SMO_DATABASE_PASSWORD_FILE): neither the compose file nor any container's
# environment carries the password.
