"""PR-HA-2: keep asking every replicated module for /health while the deployments are restarted one at a time.

Runs in a throwaway pod inside the cluster (the CI job `helm`), so it reaches each module through its Service, as another module does:

    kubectl -n smo run probe --image=local/smo-sme:ci --image-pull-policy=Never --restart=Never -- python3 -c "$(cat scripts/k8s_rolling_probe.py)"
    ... restart the deployments ...
    kubectl -n smo exec probe -- touch /tmp/stop

It stops when /tmp/stop appears, prints what it saw and exits 1 if a call failed twice in a row (one retry is allowed: a connection that
was already open to a pod being stopped may be reset, and a caller retries it). Not probed: onboarding and the GUI backend (they roll
with Recreate, so a restart is a gap by design) and the mock services.
