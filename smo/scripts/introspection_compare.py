"""Sets two load runs side by side: the gateway without its introspection cache and with it (PR-SEC-5.4, 5.5).

    scripts/introspection_compare.py --off load-out --on load-out/cache-30 [--seconds 30] [--out load-out/introspection-cache.md] [--min-saving 0.5]

Both directories hold what `scripts/load_run.py` writes (`load-results.json`). The table lists, for each run, the introspections SME answered, how many of them each call through
the gateway cost, the requests a second, the p50 / p95 / p99 of all calls and the errors; then what the cache saved. It FAILS (exit 1) when

  - either run has an error, a 5xx or an unexpected status on any route (a cache that breaks a route is not a saving);
  - the run without the cache did not cost about one introspection per call through the gateway (then the run was not what it says: the cache was on, or the calls skipped the check);
  - the run with the cache did not cut the introspections by at least `--min-saving` (default 0.5: half).

It never loosens anything: the numbers it reports are the measurement, and the choice of the default (`R1_INTROSPECTION_CACHE_SECONDS`, 0 today) stays the owner's
(OPEN_ITEMS.md, SEC-5.5). The latency columns are indicative: the second run follows the first on the same database, and a CI runner varies from run to run.
