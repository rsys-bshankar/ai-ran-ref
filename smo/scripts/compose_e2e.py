"""OI-2-compose-e2e: smoke-test the running docker-compose stack.

Runs INSIDE the r1-termination container (the only one that publishes a host
port, and the only vantage point from which module hostnames resolve), fed on
stdin by the CI job:

    docker compose exec -T r1-termination python3 - < scripts/compose_e2e.py

It is the fast gate before the full replay: every service answers, R1
Termination's `/bootstrap` answers, and a token-gated call is rejected
without a token. The runbook itself (§2-§27: onboarding, deployment, every
module, the four reference rApps) is replayed against the same stack by
`tests_integration/test_demo_runbook.py` with `SMO_E2E_LIVE=1`
(see `tests_integration/live.py`), which needs the stack otherwise untouched,
so this script leaves no state behind.

Exit status 0 only if every check passes; every failure is listed.
