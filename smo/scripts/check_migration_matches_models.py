"""Compares the real Postgres schema, migrated to the head revision,
against every module's own SQLAlchemy ORM model definitions, table by
table and column by column.

HISTORY.md §2: two real Postgres-only bugs (`rapp_instance`'s
`pending_upgrade_instance_id` entirely missing from the migration;
`oauth_client_id` wrongly `NOT NULL` there even though the ORM/app code
sets it back to NULL) were only ever caught by luck — the
migration-postgres CI job checked table *count* (>= 30), never columns,
and SQLite's own unit tests build their schema from the ORM models
directly, never from this file, so neither test path could ever have
caught either bug. This is that column-level check, made automatic —
the same "catch real structural drift automatically instead of relying
on human diligence" philosophy already used for the OpenAPI spec
drift-check and the docker-compose-config CI job.

Scope is deliberately narrow: column *presence* and *nullability* only
— exactly the two bug classes already found, not a full type-equality
check (SQLAlchemy's generic String()/Text()/ARRAY-with-SQLite-variant
types don't map to a single canonical Postgres type name, so a strict
type comparison would produce noise unrelated to any real bug).

Beyond those two, `main` also holds the migrated schema to the table-ownership
rules: every table has an owner in `migrations/table_owners.json`, a module with
a schema of its own (`migrations/db_roles.json`) keeps all its tables there, and
no foreign key crosses a module boundary (PR-DB-2).

Requires a live Postgres migrated to the head revision with
`python scripts/migrate.py` (SMO_DATABASE_URL), which this script also
verifies: a model change needs a revision (migrations/versions/, PR-OPS-1,
docs/adr/0001-schema-migrations.md), and the check fails until the database,
migrated to head, has the column. Run from the migration-postgres CI job.
