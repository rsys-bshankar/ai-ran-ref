# PR-OPS-10.5: upgrade a running previous release to this commit, on the same database.
#
#   scripts/check_upgrade_from_previous_release.sh [previous-tag]
#
# `check_previous_release_code.sh` (OPS-5.2) proves the OLD code runs on the NEW schema. This is the other half, the one an operator does: install the
# previous release (newest final `smo-v*` tag, built from its own source, its own `migrate` service), put real data into it with its own demo runbook,
# stop it, and start THIS commit's stack on the same database volume, so this commit's `migrate` service upgrades data that exists, not an empty schema.
# Then it checks that the data is still there and that the upgraded stack answers.
#
# The control comes first: a migration that passes on an empty database and fails on real data (a NOT NULL column with no default on a table that has
# rows) is seeded into a copy of the migrations, and the upgrade of the populated database must refuse it and leave the database where it was. A check
# that cannot fail proves nothing, and the fresh-database migration check is exactly the one that would pass this migration.
#
# Not done: the previous release's runbook is not replayed a second time on the upgraded database (it onboards a CSAR that must not already exist), and
# the data check is on what the runbook leaves (row counts per table, the packages and instances by id), not on every column.
#
# Needs docker and, on the host, the runtime dependencies (for migrate.py). Leaves nothing behind (the stack, its volumes and the worktree are removed).
