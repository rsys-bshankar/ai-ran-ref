"""A short-lived cache of SME's token introspection answers (PR-SEC-5.4).

R1 Termination asks SME whether the bearer token is active on every proxied request (`main._introspect_token`). With `R1_INTROSPECTION_CACHE_SECONDS` above 0 it
remembers an answer for that many seconds, so a burst of calls with one token costs SME one lookup. Off (0) by default: then nothing here is ever consulted and the
gateway behaves exactly as before.

What the cache promises, and what it does not:

  - A token SME said was active is honoured from the cache for at most the TTL, and never past the token's own `exp`. A token revoked at SME (its invoker offboarded) is
    therefore honoured for at most the TTL after the revocation, by any replica of the gateway.
  - A revocation made through this gateway (`DELETE /sme/invoker-registrations/{id}`, a real `purge-stale`) evicts the entries of that invoker (or all of them) at once, in
    this process, so *this* replica stops honouring the token on the next request. Other replicas do not hear about it: their bound is the TTL.
  - A token SME said was NOT active is remembered for `min(TTL, NEGATIVE_SECONDS)`: enough to take a flood of wrong tokens off SME, short enough that nothing waits long.
  - Only SME's answer is cached. "SME did not answer" (a transport error or a 5xx) is never stored, so an outage is a 503 as before, and a stored answer is never served
    past its TTL to ride one out.
  - The key is the SHA-256 of the token: the raw token is never held. The size is bounded; the oldest entry goes first when it is full.
  - A change to the role or the scope claim SME records for an invoker is seen after at most the TTL, like a revocation that does not go through this gateway.

The lookup-then-store race with a revocation is closed by a generation number: an answer fetched while a revocation was evicting is not stored.
