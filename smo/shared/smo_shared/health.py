"""Liveness and readiness probes (PR-ST-7).

Two questions, answered separately because an orchestrator acts differently on each:

  /live    "is this process running?" Always 200 while the event loop answers. A failing
           liveness probe restarts the container, so it must never depend on another
           service: a database outage would otherwise restart every module in turn.
  /ready   "should this replica receive traffic?" 200 when every registered check passes,
           else 503 with the failing checks named. A failing readiness probe only takes the
           replica out of rotation; it is the right place to look at the database and SME.
  /health  the original liveness route, kept as an alias of /live: the GUI BFF's module
           grid, DME's producer health supervision and the demo runbook already call it.

    install_health(app, checks=[database_check, sme_token_check])

A check is a plain function that raises when the dependency is unusable; its name is the
function's `__name__`. Checks run in parallel and are bounded by `READY_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
(default 3): a hung dependency is reported as `timeout` instead of hanging the probe.
The probe body names the failing check and its error class, never a connection string.
