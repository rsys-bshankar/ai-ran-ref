"""Request body size cap (PR-SEC-8.1).

A caller that sends a body larger than the cap is answered 413 before the service reads it: from the
`Content-Length` header when there is one, and by counting bytes as they arrive when there is not (chunked
uploads), stopping the read at the cap. Without a cap one request can make a service buffer as much memory as the
caller cares to send.

    app.add_middleware(BodySizeLimit, settings=lambda: (default_bytes, {"/mlmr/models/*/artifact": 50 * MIB}))

`settings` is called per request, so a limit can come from the environment at run time. Overrides match the
request path with `fnmatch`, `*` standing for anything (use it for one path segment: `/a/*/b`); the first match wins,
and a request matching none gets the default. The body of a streamed request that goes over is not answered
until the service next reads it; the middleware then ends the request with 413 as long as no response has
started.
