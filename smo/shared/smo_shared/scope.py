"""Tenant and region authorization (PR-SEC-10, docs/adr/0005-tenant-region-authorization.md): which targets a caller may touch.

A caller may carry a **scope claim**, set when its invoker is registered at SME (or edited by an operator): `{"regions": [...], "tenants": [...]}`. A target
(a managed element) carries a `region` and a `tenant` of its own. The claim is the gateway's to vouch for, the decision is the module's that owns the target:

  - SME returns the claim in the token introspection (`authz_scope`); R1 Termination forwards it as `X-R1-Scope` (JSON), dropping any value a caller sent;
  - an SMO module acting for an rApp passes the rApp's claim on in `X-R1-On-Behalf-Scope` (`R1Client` adds it by itself, like `X-R1-On-Behalf-Of`); R1 Termination
    forwards that header only from an `internal` caller;
  - the module that owns the data calls `scope_of(request.headers)` and then `permits(...)` / `filter_statement(...)`, so every module decides the same way.

The semantics (one rule, no exceptions):

  - **no claim** (`None`): unscoped. Everything is permitted, exactly as before this existed. An SMO module on its own account and the operator's GUI are unscoped.
  - **a claim**: every axis it names must match. `regions` names the regions the caller may touch, `tenants` the tenants; an axis the claim leaves out is not restricted.
    A target is permitted when, for each restricted axis, its value is set and is one of the listed. Matching is exact and case-sensitive (no wildcards, no hierarchy).
  - **a target with no region (or tenant)** is therefore not permitted to a caller that restricts that axis; only an unscoped caller sees it.
  - **a claim that cannot be read** (a malformed header) permits nothing (`DENY_ALL`): a restriction must never be lost because it was damaged.

An empty list is not a valid claim (it would be a caller that may touch nothing: stop the rApp with the kill switch instead), and `{}` is no claim.
