"""Optimistic concurrency for rows that carry a lifecycle state (PR-ST-2).

Several replicas of one module may load the same row, fire the same FSM
transition and write it back. Without a check the last writer silently wins
and a transition can be applied twice. `Versioned` adds an integer
`row_version` and makes SQLAlchemy emit every UPDATE as
`... WHERE pk = :pk AND row_version = :loaded_version`; when another session
committed first the UPDATE matches no row and SQLAlchemy raises
`StaleDataError`, which `install_concurrency_handler` turns into a 409
ProblemDetails (`CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION`) instead of a 500.

The check covers every ORM write to the row, not only FSM transitions, so a
concurrent update of any column is detected. A caller that gets the 409 simply
repeats the request: the handler reloads the row, so the repeat either
succeeds or is refused as an illegal transition because the other writer
already moved it (`smo_sdk` does this once, see `sdk/smo_sdk/_common.py`).

Core / bulk statements (`update(...).where(...)`) do not carry the check.
