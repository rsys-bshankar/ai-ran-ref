"""Declares, in each service's own generated OpenAPI spec, the R1 gateway
security this build already really enforces at runtime — without adding any
enforcing dependency to that service itself.

r1-termination/app/main.py's own `_authorized()` is the ONE real enforcement
point: RFC 7662 introspection against SME's token issuer, on every proxied
request, fail-closed. No individual backend service (aimgf, dme, mlmr, ...)
has ever had its own auth check — they all trust the gateway that's the only
way a real R1 consumer ever reaches them. That's still true after this
module exists: it only makes the OpenAPI contract honest about an interface
that was already real, not a new runtime behavior. See HISTORY.md §2 and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Wave 3
cross-cutting standardization item.

R1_CONTRACT_VERSION is this build's own semantic version for "the current,
Wave-3-complete R1 contract shape" — not a claim to match any one external
3GPP/O-RAN spec's own info.version, since most of these services compose
several specs (or none) rather than implement exactly one 1:1.
