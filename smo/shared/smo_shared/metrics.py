"""Prometheus metrics for every service (PR-OBS-2).

    install_metrics(app)   an HTTP middleware plus `GET /metrics` in the Prometheus text format

Two series per service, labelled by method, **route template** (`/models/{model_id}`, never the raw path, so the
label set stays bounded) and status code:

  smo_http_requests_total{method,route,status}
  smo_http_request_duration_seconds{method,route,status}   histogram

Two more families come from the shared library itself (PR-OBS-2.4, 2.5):

  smo_fsm_transitions_total{machine,from_state,event,to_state}   every transition a state machine takes
  smo_fsm_illegal_transitions_total{machine,from_state,event}    every refused one
  smo_db_pool_connections{state}                                 in_use / idle / overflow, read at scrape time
  smo_db_pool_capacity                                           pool_size + max_overflow

`machine` is the name of the state enum (`JobState`, `ModelLifecycleState`, ...), so the label set is the declared states and
events and nothing else. SQLAlchemy does not expose how many callers are waiting for a connection, so there is no "waiting" gauge: a
pool that is exhausted shows as `in_use` equal to `smo_db_pool_capacity`.

Outbound calls (PR-OBS-2.6) are counted where they leave the process:

  smo_outbound_calls_total{client,target,method,outcome}
  smo_outbound_call_duration_seconds{client,target}      histogram

`client` is `r1` (a call through R1 Termination, `R1Client`) or `webhook` (a caller-registered callback, `smo_shared.webhook`). `target`
for `r1` is the module in the path (`sme`, `dme`, ...), a small fixed set; for `webhook` it is the constant `callback`, **never the
host**: the destination is whatever a caller registered, so a host label would let any caller grow the series without bound. `outcome` is
`2xx`/`3xx`/`4xx`/`5xx`, `timeout`, `error` (could not connect or any other transport failure) or `blocked` (the SSRF guard refused the
destination, nothing was sent). R1Client counts each attempt, so the one retry after a 401 shows as two calls.

R1 Termination's introspection cache (PR-SEC-5.4, off unless `R1_INTROSPECTION_CACHE_SECONDS` is above 0):

  smo_introspection_cache_total{result}                   `hit` (answered from the cache) or `miss` (SME was asked); the SME calls saved are the hits

Business series (PR-OBS-4), all low-cardinality (a label is a state, a status, a module or a refusal class, never an id, a path or a host):

  smo_refusals_total{module,reason}                       every 4xx answer, by module and a fixed class (`unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`,
                                                          `conflict`, `invalid`, `too_large`, `rate_limited`, `other_4xx`), counted by the middleware
  smo_outbox_rows{module,status}                          this module's notification_outbox rows by PENDING / SENT / DEAD (the backlog), read at scrape time
  smo_outbox_oldest_pending_age_seconds{module}           age of this module's oldest PENDING row (0 when none): the delivery lag
  smo_rapp_packages{state}                                onboarding: packages by lifecycle state (rApps onboarded)
  smo_rapp_instances{state}                               rapp-mgmt: instances by lifecycle state (`RUNNING` are the active rApps)
  smo_intents{admin_state}                                intent-service: intents (the policy objects, since A1 left) by admin state
  smo_worker_task_runs_total{module,task,outcome}         a worker's periodic tasks that ran (`ok` or `failed`; a skipped offer is not counted)
  smo_worker_task_last_success_timestamp_seconds{module,task}
  smo_retention_off_rows{table}                           rows (an estimate) of a table whose retention is `0`, set by the worker's purge task each hour
                                                          (`smo_shared.retention.report_retention_off`); no series for a table whose retention is on

State gauges are read from the database when Prometheus scrapes (`register_query_gauge`, cached `SMO_BUSINESS_METRICS_TTL_SECONDS`, default 15):
the request path pays nothing, "values match the DB" is true by construction, and a database that cannot answer yields no series for that
scrape instead of an error. Every replica of a module reports the same value: aggregate with `max`, not `sum`. The worker has no HTTP server;
`SMO_WORKER_METRICS_PORT` (unset: off) makes it serve `/metrics` on that port.

Unmatched paths are one `route="unmatched"` series. Probes and `/metrics` itself are not counted: a scrape every
15 s would otherwise be most of the traffic.

`/metrics` is for the compose / cluster network only. Prometheus scrapes each container directly; R1 Termination
refuses `/<module>/metrics` so a token holder cannot read another module's series through the gateway, and the TLS
edge does not forward `/metrics`. R1's own `/metrics` is on its container port, which `docker-compose.yml` publishes
for development; production publishes only the edge (`PR-SEC-9`).

Metrics are held per process. With `UVICORN_WORKERS` above 1 each worker answers with its own counters and a scrape
sees one of them; keep one worker per container and scale replicas (the default), or add multiprocess mode first.
