"""Transactional notification outbox (PR-MSG-1.2 to 1.4).

A notification to a caller-supplied destination used to be an inline `post_webhook` in the middle of a request: if the
process died after the change committed and before (or while) the notification went out, the notification was lost, and
if the request rolled back after the notification went out, a consumer had been told about something that never
happened. The outbox fixes both: the notification is a row written in the same transaction as the change, and is sent
only after that transaction commits.

    from smo_shared.outbox import enqueue

    def change_something(db):
        ...                                           # the change
        enqueue(db, destination, {"eventType": "X"})  # inserted in the caller's transaction
        db.commit()                                   # the row exists exactly when the change does; sent right after

  enqueue(db, destination, payload, module=None, method="POST")
        Adds a PENDING row to `db`'s transaction (nothing is sent, nothing is flushed). A destination the SSRF guard
        refuses is dropped with a warning, as `post_webhook` always did, and None is returned. `module` defaults to
        the container's `MODULE`. `method` is `POST` (the payload is the JSON body) or `DELETE` (a command whose answer nothing reads, such as
        telling a producer to stop a job: the payload is `{}`); the row is sent, retried and killed the same way either way. Rolling
        the transaction back removes the row.
  drain(engine, ids=None, now=None, limit=100)
        Sends rows that are PENDING and due, oldest first, and records the outcome. With `ids` only those rows (what
        the commit hook below passes); without, every due row (what a worker or a recovery sweep does, MSG-2). A row
        is claimed with one atomic UPDATE that moves its `next_attempt_at` a lease ahead, so two replicas never send
        the same row and a process that dies mid-send leaves a row that becomes due again when the lease runs out
        (delivery is at least once). A 2xx-4xx answer marks it SENT (a 4xx is the destination refusing, which a retry
        will not change); no answer or a 5xx counts an attempt and schedules the next with a backoff; after
        `MAX_ATTEMPTS` the row is DEAD, and so is a row whose destination the SSRF guard refuses at send time.
        Returns {"sent": n, "retry": n, "dead": n}.
  inline drain
        After every commit of a session that enqueued, the rows that session enqueued are drained in the same thread
        (a SQLAlchemy `after_commit` listener), which is what the inline `post_webhook` did, minus the two failure
        modes above. It never raises into the caller. Failed rows are not retried inline, so a dead destination does
        not slow every later request; they wait for the next full `drain`, which is MSG-2's worker.
        `SMO_OUTBOX_INLINE_DRAIN=false` turns the inline drain off (a worker does all the sending, MSG-2.5).

SENT rows are kept for `SMO_OUTBOX_SENT_RETENTION_SECONDS` (default 86400) for the delivery log (MSG-5) and then removed by a
full drain. The table is created by schema revision `0002`; its `method` column by `0005`.
