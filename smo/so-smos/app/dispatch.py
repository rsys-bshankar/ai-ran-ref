"""The dispatch table of SO SMOS and the order executor: each (stepType, targetModule) pair is one R1 call to a module of this build.

What it is: SO SMOS LLD section 1 made executable. `DISPATCH_TABLE` maps a pair to a dispatcher function; each dispatcher builds the request body from the step dict and posts it
through the `R1Client` it is given; `execute_order` runs the steps in order with the fail-fast rule of section 1.1.

Where it sits: called by `app/main.py` (`submit_service_order`); calls RAN NF OAM, NFO, FOCOM and AIMgF over R1. It has no database access and no state.

What it owns: the mapping and the execution semantics (sequential, first failure halts, no rollback of completed steps). Each downstream module owns the validation of its own request.

Before editing: a new step type is one dispatcher plus one table entry; a downstream error response must go through `_ensure_ok` or the step would be recorded COMPLETED.
