"""The plumbing every namespace client shares: `SdkError`, `ensure_ok`, the retry-on-conflict wrapper and `BaseClient`.

Golden rule 6 (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): the SDK is a thin client over the same R1 Termination path as every other cross-module call. Each client class wraps `R1Client` with one typed
method per platform route; this file is the one place where a response becomes either a return value or an `SdkError`, and where a write that lost a race is repeated. A transport
error (`httpx.HTTPError`) is not caught anywhere: only an HTTP answer becomes `SdkError`. Change `ensure_ok` or `_RetryOnConflict` with care, because every method of all six clients
goes through them; `tests/test_retry_on_conflict.py` and the per-client tests pin their behaviour.
