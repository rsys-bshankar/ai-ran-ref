"""The AI Runtime SDK: the package an rApp author imports (`from smo_sdk import AiRuntimeSdk`).

`AiRuntimeSdk` is six namespace clients (`data`, `analytics`, `models`, `lifecycle`, `intent`, `platform`) over one shared `smo_shared.r1_client.R1Client`, so an rApp calls
`sdk.models.register_model(...)` instead of hand-building an HTTP request against `/mlmr/models`. Golden rule 6 of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: the SDK is a thin client over the same R1
path every other cross-module call uses, not a second one. It adds no business logic and no client-side validation; the platform's answer, when it is an error, is raised as `SdkError`.

Nothing in the SMO modules imports it (they call `R1Client` directly); the sample rApps under `samples/` and rApp authors do. `operator_ui.py` is authoring support and is imported
by name (`from smo_sdk import operator_ui`), not through `AiRuntimeSdk`. Per-method behaviour and design decisions are in `sdk/README.md`; update it with a change here.
