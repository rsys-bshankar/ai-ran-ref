"""Fixtures of the SDK unit tests: a recording fake of `R1Client`.

The `r1` fixture records every call the code under test makes (verb, path, params, json, files) and answers from a scripted response, the same "replace the R1 client" shape other modules'
tests use for their service doubles. Every recorded call is also checked against the gateway's role policy: the SDK must not make a change an rApp is not allowed to make
(`smo_shared.roles.rapp_may_change`, PR-SEC-14). Needs `smo_shared` on the path (`PYTHONPATH=.:../shared`); no network and no database.
