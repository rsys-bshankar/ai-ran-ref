"""Unit tests of `app/statemachine.py`: the ModelLifecycle table (14 states), the RuntimeLifecycle table (8 states), the inference-job table, the event sets
(`GOVERNANCE_EVENTS`, `ADVANCEABLE_EVENTS`, `TRAINABLE_STATES`) and `should_trigger_group_retrain`.

Pure Python: no database, no HTTP, no fixtures. Run with `cd smo/aimgf && PYTHONPATH=.:../shared python -m pytest tests/test_statemachine.py -q`. The tests pin the
shape README 2.3 documents, so a changed edge fails here before a route test notices.
