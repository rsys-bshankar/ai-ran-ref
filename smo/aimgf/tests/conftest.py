"""Pytest configuration of the aimgf unit tests: switches on the in-memory SQLite fallback of `smo_shared.db` before the application is imported.

Without a database URL `smo_shared.db` refuses to start unless `SMO_ALLOW_SQLITE_FALLBACK` is set; this file sets it for the whole suite. It defines no fixtures.
Run the suite from `smo/aimgf` with `PYTHONPATH=.:../shared python -m pytest tests -q`.

# before any application module is imported, because smo_shared.db builds its engine at import.
