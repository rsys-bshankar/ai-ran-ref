"""AIMgF's three state machines and the group-retrain rule, as plain data: no database, no HTTP, no NFO.

What it is: the transition tables for `ModelLifecycle` (14 states, a model's certification path: training, validation, emulation, governance, deprecation,
retirement), `RuntimeLifecycle` (8 states, the model's serving runtime, jointly owned with NFO) and the inference-job FSM (RUNNING to COMPLETED or FAILED),
plus the event sets that decide which route may fire which event and `should_trigger_group_retrain`. The two lifecycle FSMs move independently on the one
`model_lifecycle` row: retraining a PROMOTED model does not take its runtime down, and a runtime can be scaled or terminated without touching certification.

Where it sits: `main.py` fires the tables through `_fire_model_event` and `_fire_runtime_event`, which turn `IllegalTransition` into 409
`LIFECYCLE_ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` and record a `LifecycleTransition` row; `nrm.py` imports `TRAINABLE_STATES`. The engine is `smo_shared.statemachine.StateMachine`.
Design record: `aimgf/README.md` 2.3, HISTORY.md OI-6.1 (operator approval gates), OI-2-governance-bypass, OI-2-training-lifecycle-edges and
OI-2-model-eol-serving.

Owns: which (state, event) pairs are legal and the event sets. Does not own: the checks that read the row rather than the state (`training_approved` and
`validation_approved` are tested in `main._start_validation` and `request_emulation`), or any NFO call.

Before editing: `tests/test_statemachine.py` pins the state counts (14 and 8) and the edge sets; README 2.3 lists every edge, so change both. A new
`ModelLifecycleEvent` that is neither in `ADVANCEABLE_EVENTS` nor in `main._JOB_ROUTE_FOR_EVENT` makes `POST /models/{id}/advance` fail with a KeyError (500)
instead of the 422 that names the job route.
