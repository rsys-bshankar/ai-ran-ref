"""The TS 28.105 AI/ML NRM datatypes (`specs/5G_APIs/TS28105_AiMlNrm.yaml`) as pydantic models and closed enums, used to validate request bodies and to
store attribute values as spec-shaped JSON.

What it is: one class per spec datatype that AIMgF accepts or returns, keeping the spec's own camelCase attribute names (hence names such as `fLRole`),
and the closed `Literal` enums (`RequestStatus`, `MLTrainingType`, `ActivationStatus`, ...). Every model inherits `_Spec`, whose `extra="forbid"` turns an
attribute the spec does not define into a 422 instead of letting it be stored silently. `dump()` writes a model (or list of models) as plain JSON with
`None` fields left out, which is what the JSON columns of `models.py` hold, so what is read back is exactly what the spec describes.

Where it sits: `nrm.py` uses the datatypes in its request bodies and calls `dump()` before storing; `main.py` uses `ModelPerformance`, `FLReportPerClient`,
`InferenceOutput` and `PotentialImpactInfo` in the completion and resolve bodies. Design record: HISTORY.md W4-04, `docs/STANDARDS.md` decision D-9.

Owns: validation of the datatype shapes. Does not own: any storage, any HTTP route, or the DN containment tree. Attributes of type `Dn`, `DnRo` and `DnListRo`
are carried as this build's own resource ids (UUID strings): flat resources instead of a DN tree is the one recorded deviation from the spec.

Before editing: the classes are part of the published request schemas, so a change to a field is a change to `docs/openapi/aimgf.json` (rerun
`scripts/generate_openapi_specs.py`; `tests_integration/test_openapi_specs.py` fails otherwise). That is also why the notes on the classes are `#` comments:
a docstring on a model would be published as its schema description.
