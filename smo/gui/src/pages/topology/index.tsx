/** RAN topology page (route /topology, BRIEF §4e feature 1, handoff `Topology.dc.html`): relation counts, a focus-one-element neighbour graph,
 * a containment relation check, the focused element's summary, the containment tree with its alarm overlay (GUI-3) and the table of relations
 * that need attention. Layout only: each box is a
 * section under `sections/`, its data in `data/queries.ts`; the focused element and the problem filter live in the URL (`?me=`, `?problem=`).
 * The Dashboard's "Open topology" link lands here. Sections and limits: README.md. */
