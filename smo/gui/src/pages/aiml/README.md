# AI/ML

Route: `/aiml`    Design: handoff `Aiml.dc.html` (BRIEF §4 AI/ML, §4e features 7 and 8; SCALE.md "AI/ML")

Model registration → training → validation → certification → deployment → inference
(`docs/call-flows/02-aiml-model-train-to-inference.md`). Tabs (URL hash): `models` (default), `training`, `inference`, `features`,
`groups` (coordination), `mlmf`, `registry`. The pre-redesign ids are unchanged. `Mlmf` is also mounted by the KPIs page (`#mlmf`).

First load of the Models tab: 7 calls (summary, stage counts, four board reads, the training card), pinned by `__tests__/Aiml.test.tsx`.
Selecting a model adds about 7 (detail, lifecycle, guard, governance, jobs). Every other tab: 1–3.

## Known limits

- **Counts by stage** are AIMgF's counts by model lifecycle state (`/aimgf/model-lifecycles/counts`) plus MLMR's model total for models AIMgF
  has no row for. They are by state, not runtime: a model with an active runtime is counted in its state's column but drawn under "Active
  runtime", whose count is its cards. The cards still come from one read of up to 500 models and 500 lifecycles (the backend's MAX_LIMIT).
- **"Top 5 by last change"**: no "last changed" time is served per model, so each column shows its first five in registry order.
- **Guard-floor outline**: a model is outlined when the newest report of one of its MLMF subscriptions, among the 100 newest reports overall,
  breached. A model whose last report is older than those 100 is not outlined.
- **Training epoch / ETA** show only when the run's runtime reports epochs (`POST /aimgf/training-jobs/{id}/progress`); the ETA is AIMgF's
  linear estimate ((now − started) / epoch × epochs left), not a trainer forecast.
- **Deprecate / Retire rationale**: AIMgF records a rationale only for governance events (roll back); deprecate and retire appear in the
  lifecycle history, and the rationale typed for them is sent but not stored.
- **Registry writes**: the BFF exposes no write on repositories or storages; the Registry tab is read-only. MLMR has no list of a model's
  artifact versions: they are counted from `artifactLocation` when it has the form MLMR writes on upload, `model-artifact:<model id>:<latest>`
  (`data/board.ts` `ARTIFACT_LOCATION_RE`, GUI-10.6); any other location (an external URI) lists no version.
- **Inference card** of the mockup ("last 5 jobs") is not on the Models tab, to keep its first load within 7 calls; the Inference tab has them.
- **Scope** (GUI-9.3): models, training and MLMF know no region; under a scope the page header says "network-wide".

## Troubleshooting

- Board says "Guard-floor outlines unavailable": AIMgF's MLMF routes failed; the board still groups by stage.
- A model sits in "Registered" though it was trained: AIMgF has no lifecycle row for it (it defaults to REGISTERED); check `/aimgf/model-lifecycles`.
- No "Roll back" button: only an admin may send ROLLBACK, DEPRECATE and RETIRE (`gui-bff/app/rbac.py`), and only from a state that allows it.
- Feature groups say "operators and admins only": a viewer may not read them (they hold datalake credentials).
