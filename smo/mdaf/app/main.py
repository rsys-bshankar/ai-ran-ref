"""MDAF (Management Data Analytics Function): the app that stores analytics reports, tells subscribers about them and
publishes the DME-sourced rule (TS 28.104 MDA). The TS 28.104 resources (MDAFunction, MDARequest, MDAReport) are in `mda.py`,
mounted at the bottom of this file.

Where it sits: one FastAPI app behind R1 Termination at `/mdaf`. Producers (rApps through the SDK) publish reports; consumers
subscribe, query and create MDA requests. Outgoing calls: `GET /dme/data-jobs/{id}` for every report input source
(`_validate_input_sources_are_real_dme_artifacts`) and, from `mda.py`, AIMgF for drift forwarding. Notifications to subscribers
and request targets are written to the transactional outbox (`smo_shared.outbox`, PR-MSG-1.8) and sent after the commit.
`ran-analytics` is a separate producer registry; there is no call either way. Design records: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (MDAF),
the MDAF section of `HISTORY.md` §7, and `docs/STANDARDS.md` decision D-9.

What it owns: reports, subscriptions (with their threshold bookkeeping) and, in `mda.py`, MDA functions, requests and
deliveries. What it does not own: producer registration (`ran-analytics`), and DME's O1 action path (MDAF only reads DME's
data path to prove a report's sources are real).

Before editing: `publish_report` and `mda.publish_mda_report` each end in one commit that persists the report, the outbox rows
and the threshold state together; notification helpers must not commit on their own. `mda.py` imports helpers from this file,
so it is imported last (see the end of the file). The docstrings of routes and request models are published in
`docs/openapi/mdaf.json`.
