"""UpgradeInstance orchestration — Onboarding/rApp Mgmt LLD section 6.

Coordinates two RAppInstance rows through statemachine.py's per-row FSM.
Kept separate from the FSM itself because this is cross-entity choreography
(a saga), not a single state machine — same separation used for the
NFO -> FOCOM dependency in the NFO+FOCOM LLD.

The replacement row is a complete instance (OI-2-upgrade-completeness,
OI-1-upgrade-identity): it goes through CreateInstance's own
`provision_instance` (package-state check, its own fresh oauth_client_id,
NFO Instantiate, usage/start) and inherits the old row's configuration,
autonomy mode and region scope. Whichever row loses is torn down the way
TERMINATE tears an instance down — DME/SME deregistration and credential
revocation (the FSM action), then NFO Terminate and usage/stop
(`release_instance_resources`) — before its row is deleted.

Every commit is recorded as a RAppInstanceVersion (OI-1-sa-rollback): what
the retired row ran, and the lineage link from it to its successor. A
rollback (`start_rollback`) is an upgrade back to the newest version not
already rolled back — the same two-row choreography, timeout and
auto-rollback, so a failed rollback leaves the current version running.

upgradeTimeoutSeconds is enforced lazily: no scheduler exists in this
build, so an unresolved upgrade whose replacement was created more than
`old.upgrade_timeout_seconds` ago is rolled back the next time either row
is touched (`expire_overdue_upgrade`, called from main.py's reads and
lifecycle routes).
