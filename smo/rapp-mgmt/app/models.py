"""The tables of rApp Management: the rApp instance, its upgrade/rollback version history and the fault and performance reports an instance sent.

Written by `main.py`, `provisioning.py` and `upgrade.py` (the routes, the provisioning and teardown calls, the upgrade choreography) and migrated by
`migrations/` (the ORM models must match it: `scripts/check_migration_matches_models.py`). References to other modules' tables (the package, its usage
registration) are bare UUID columns, not ORM foreign keys, because this module runs in its own process (`tests_integration/test_module_isolation.py`).
The lifecycle rules for `RAppInstance.state` are in `statemachine.py`, not here.
