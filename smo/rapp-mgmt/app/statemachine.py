"""RAppInstance lifecycle.

SMO Design v1.3 section 3.5 state diagram, made precise by Onboarding/rApp
Mgmt LLD section 6: UpgradeInstance is TWO rows in choreography (old kept
running, new deployed alongside it), not one row transitioning through an
'upgrading' state in place. The FSM below governs each row's own
transitions; upgrade.py is the orchestrator that coordinates both rows
and applies the timeout/auto-rollback policy.
